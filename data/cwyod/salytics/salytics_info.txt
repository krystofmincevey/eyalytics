181115122599	Issue - Access to Basic Services-Beta	A factor that assesses the degree to which a company's exposure deviates from its subindustry's exposure on a material ESG issue. The beta is multiplied with the subindustry issue exposure score to derive a company-specific issue exposure score for a material ESG issue. It normally ranges from 0 to 2, with 0 indicating no exposure, 1 indicating the subindustry average (as represented by the subindustry exposure score), and 2 indicating exposure that is twice the subindustry average.

Setting the beta to above 2 requires a special sign-off procedure. The issue beta is derived either from quantitative model (see quantitative issue beta) that captures multiple factors that have an influence on company-specific risk or a qualitative overlay (see issue beta overlay) that allows analysts to reflect factors that are not captured by the quantitative model, and includes also issue exposure adjustments in case of category 4 or 5 events.

Setting the beta to above 2 requires a special sign-off procedure. The issue beta is derived either from quantitative model (see quantitative issue beta) that captures multiple factors that have an influence on company-specific risk or a qualitative overlay (see issue beta overlay) that allows analysts to reflect factors that are not captured by the quantitative model, and includes also issue exposure adjustments in case of category 4 or 5 events.

This weight is based on the management indicator weight (default) and adjusted in case of indicator disabling (i.e. if the indicator is not relevant to the company's business) or events occurring in the issue. If the indicator is disabled, its weight is set to 0%. If events occur, the management indicators in the issue receive a discount according to the events logic. In both cases, the weight for the remaining management indicators is distributed according to their default weights as indicator weights within a material ESG issue (including events indicator weights) always sum up to 100%.

331617112299	NCPC - Natural Disasters-Score-BMR	This indicator leverages the WorldRiskIndex, as provided in the WorldRiskReport by Ruhr Universitat Bochum and IFHV, which states the disaster risk for 172 of the worldï¿½s countries. The Index considers exposure to extreme natural events such as earthquakes or cyclones, and calculates a societyï¿½s capacity to respond to such events. The data is transformed by Sustainalytics in a 0-100 scale to make it more intuitive, and then used in the Country Risk Rating. Countries receive a higher score only if they outperform their peers on the given indicator. For further information, please refer to the Country Risk Rating Methodology Document.
