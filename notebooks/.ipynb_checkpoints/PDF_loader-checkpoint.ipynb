    "## Attempt 1:\n",
    "Load in textual information seperately from tabular information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading Text:**\n",
    "To get more structured results, you can dive a bit deeper into the pdfminer library to analyze the individual layout components of the PDF. By iterating through these components, you can customize your extraction strategy based on the type and structure of each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more granular approach using pdfminer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parse the PDF and extract layout objects.\n",
    "- Classify each object based on its type (text box, image, line, etc.)\n",
    "- Custom process each text box, ensuring tables (previously identified) are skipped to avoid duplicate extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading Table:**\n",
    "This automatic detection sometimes confuses text layouts with tables, especially when the text is arranged in columns or has other grid-like structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refine the extraction process, we can use a combination of heuristic approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Density Check: For each table detected by camelot, calculate the text density. If there's a lot of whitespace relative to text, it might not be a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row and Column Count: Check the number of rows and columns. If there's just one column or one row, it might be just regular text instead of a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row Uniformity: Check if the rows have similar content. If each row is wildly different in terms of content length or type, it might not be a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvements**:\n",
    "Few additional ideas and improvements could help capture more structured content:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Context Preservation around Tables:*\n",
    "As you mentioned, it might be valuable to add sentences or headings appearing immediately before and after tables as added context.You can modify the extract_text_custom function to look for text boxes immediately above and below identified table regions and append these to the table markdown content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Images and Figures Extraction:*\n",
    "Right now, the images or figures are skipped. Depending on the nature of the PDFs you're working with, images, charts, and figures might contain essential information. Tools like Pytesseract can be used to OCR images, but the quality of results can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use PyPDF2 for Meta Information:*\n",
    "Sometimes the meta information of a PDF, such as the title, author, or other metadata, contains important context about the content. You can extract this with PyPDF2 and include it in your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Error Handling for Individual Pages:*\n",
    "Instead of failing the entire operation when an error occurs on one page, you can handle errors on a per-page basis. This way, even if one page causes an issue, the rest of the pages can still be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Text Post-processing:*\n",
    "Once the text is extracted, you might notice inconsistencies like broken sentences or words. Depending on the quality and structure of the PDFs, some text post-processing might be helpful. This could involve:\n",
    "- Removing any residual special characters or artifacts.\n",
    "- Reconstructing broken sentences.\n",
    "- Removing footers, headers, or repeated elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Parallel Processing:*\n",
    "If the processing time becomes an issue, especially with large PDFs, you can consider parallel processing for different pages. This would involve extracting content from multiple pages concurrently. Python’s multiprocessing module can help here."

      "Renewable electricity usage, which was third- party assured for the first time in 2021, increased from 12% in 2021 to 21% in 2022.\n",
      "To build knowledge across our system and increase the generation, procurement and accurate reporting of renewable energy, we published a Renewable Energy Implementation Guidebook in March 2022. This guidebook provides a step-by-step process for associates across the system to implement on-site solar photovoltaic and solar hot water and steam systems, on-site and off-site renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), coupled with energy attribute certificates to align with GHG Protocol Scope 2 quality criteria.\n",
      "In addition to the guidebook, we launched a future-facing initiative called the Renewable Energy Project Pipeline in 2022, where we work closely with bottling partners to increase the number of renewable energy projects throughout our system. Approximately 20 bottling partners and 13 concentrate plants have developed 2023–2025 renewable energy plans. As the number and scope of these projects expands, we will look for opportunities to collaborate\n",

      "and consumers.\n",
      "In September 2022, Arca Continental committed to setting a science-based target. This adds to the growing list of our bottlers with approved emissions reductions goals through the Science- Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This list includes Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (CCHBC), Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), AB Inbev, Swire Coca-Cola Limited and Coca-Cola FEMSA.\n",

      "We continue to find new ways to collaborate and support our suppliers to collectively reduce emissions.\n",
      "In 2022, we joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LoCT) initiative, led by Guidehouse along with 18 other companies to mobilize collective climate action by providing suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to accelerate their decarbonization. As of the end of 2022, there were 94 suppliers to the Coca-Cola system participating in the initiative. The company is directly sponsoring 56 of these suppliers. The program is showing signs of success—10 suppliers that we sponsored, who successfully completed the program, have since set or committed to setting their own SBTi- approved emissions targets.\n",

      "Coolers have long been a key opportunity because approximately one-third of our emissions comes from cold-drink equipment and dispensing. In early 2023, building on analysis we conducted in 2022, we published internal guidance for coolers used across our value chain. The guidance sets specific energy usage limits, which will require increasing energy efficiency between now and 2030 and help drive the replacement of older, less efficient coolers.\n",
      "We are also installing more “intelligent connected” coolers that can transmit data such as product throughput, maintenance status, temperature and energy use, which has operational benefits in addition to helping reduce emissions.\n",

Improving our data helps us prioritize projects and programs with the greatest impact, including more detail on renewable energy usage and more data from suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Validate Renewable Energy Claims\n",
      "One area of focus has been to validate the accuracy and completeness of our renewable energy claims. We have done this through assuring our claims to the GHG Protocol. This work began in 2021 and continued through 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppliers Disclose Data and Targets\n",
      "Because approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from goods and services we buy, it is essential to engage with suppliers to accurately capture our full scope 3 emissions and ensure our suppliers join our decarbonization journey. Each year, we encourage key suppliers to complete CDP’s Supply Chain Climate Change questionnaire, which provides useful data on GHG emissions in our supply chain and information on supplier targets and initiatives to\n",

Therefore, the reported figure includes only those allegations that required investigations only as opposed to generalized questions raised to Employee Relations. Please note, however, that all questions presented to Employee Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation. While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case management tool, we no longer capture that data. This helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual Human Rights cases. This change accounts for the 2019 variance when compared to previous years.\n",
