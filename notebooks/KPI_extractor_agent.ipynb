      "Halle, 9 June 2023 FINANCIAL YEAR 2022/23\n",
      "Annual report presented by the Board of Directors to the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders\n",
      "of 27 September 2023 and Independent auditor’s report\n",
      "The Dutch annual report in the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) is the only official version.\n",
      "Dit jaarverslag is ook verkrijgbaar in het Nederlands.\n",
      "Ce rapport annuel est également disponible en français.\n",
      "Financial year 2022/23 covers the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023.\n",
      "This annual report is also available on colruytgroup.com/en/annualreport. Our corporate website also includes all press releases, extra stories and background information.\n",
      "Word from the Chairman\n",
      "2022/23 was an eventful, challenging financial year, in which we have continued to evolve, based on our belief that we create added value for society today, tomorrow and in the long term. Over the past thirty years, Colruyt Group has evolved from a family business to a large, diverse group of companies. After years of double-digit growth, we are now experiencing a period of slowdown. This is not uncommon, especially in a context of high inflation that is seriously challenging all retailers and has sharply increased our costs, among other things for energy and employee pay. In retrospect, we are proud that, despite all this, we achieved good revenue growth and consolidated our market share.\n",
      "Continuing to consolidate our long-term strategy required us to take a number of difficult decisions, which after careful consideration of various scenarios proved to be unavoidable.\n",
      "Thus, we published our decision for Dreamland to structurally join forces with Belgian toy specialist ToyChamp in April. In addition, we announced our intention to restructure Dreamland and Dreambaby, applying the ‘Renault Act’ collective redundancy scheme to a number of employees, and closing one Dreamland and five Dreambaby stores. We are convinced that these actions can contribute to the continued existence of Dreamland (now together with ToyChamp) and to that of Dreambaby as an integral part of the group. We are working towards this together, in constructive consultation with our trade union partners. We are and remain incredibly grateful and proud of the people who give the best of themselves for these attractive brands in our non-food area.\n",
      "During the past financial year we also implemented numerous small and large cost saving, optimisation and efficiency measures. The sales, logistics, production and support services focused on\n",
      "controlling their operational costs and specifically on energy efficiency. Energy prices started falling again from the beginning of 2023, while the joint market share of Colruyt Lowest Prices, Okay and Spar in Belgium increased to 31,0% at the end of the financial year. Partly as a result of this, we were able to slightly adjust in a positive direction our outlook for the full-year results. Ultimately, our revenue for the financial year increased by 7,7%, to over 10,8 billion euros. The net result decreased by one percentage point to 1,9% of revenue.\n",
      "In the coming financial year, we will maintain our increased focus on efficiency and continue to implement our strategic plan.\n",
      "We are convinced that we will emerge stronger from the current period. We therefore continue to expand our smart ecosystem, with products and services in four areas, where a significant portion of family budgets is spent. In the fields of nutrition\n",
      "and health, in particular, we have taken major steps through investments, participations and acquisitions. Our Jims fitness chain boosted its muscle by acquiring six high-quality clubs from the Oxygen chain. We also took a shareholding in digital health platform yoboo, strong in personal counselling towards healthier lifestyles. Finally, our Newpharma online pharmacy expanded its storage space to over 20.000 m², with potential for future growth. At the beginning of 2023, we concluded an agreement in principle to acquire 100% of the Degrenne Distribution group, a significant regional player in the French convenience store market. The company perfectly complements our Codifrance wholesale branch and will significantly strengthen our presence in France. Our retail network also continued to grow in Belgium and Luxembourg, with 13 new food stores and 22 renovations, representing 13.400 m² of additional retail space.\n",
      "Our Colruyt Lowest Prices format experienced its greatest expansion. With its unique lowest price guarantee, it is clearly more relevant than ever. With food price inflation continuing, Colruyt attracted many new customers from autumn 2022 onwards and increased its market share. We continued\n",
      "to protect our customers’ purses and purchasing power, even during the often challenging annual negotiations with suppliers. We nonetheless succeeded in devising solutions acceptable to all parties, with a view to our lowest price\n",
      "guarantee (which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year) and our long-term supplier relationships.\n",
      "We have also set a new course in the energy field. Our energy holding company Virya Energy reached an agreement to sell its offshore wind energy platform Parkwind to Japanese energy group JERA Green. The takeover offers Parkwind the potential to develop further as a leading international energy player, based in our country. This was a necessary step in an increasingly competitive offshore industry with substantially larger projects and higher investment risks.\n",
      "At the beginning of June 2023, we completed the sale of fuel specialist DATS 24 to Virya Energy. In a rapidly greening energy market, the holding company will gain a lot of clout from this pooling of expertise. For our customers, nothing changes: DATS 24 remains part of the Xtra ecosystem.\n",
      "In the past financial year, we again worked hard on numerous innovation and sustainability initiatives. These include new technologies to speed up checkout flow, while making work more ergonomic for our employees. We have experimented with unmanned vehicles for home delivery from Collect&Go and further digitised our processes and systems.\n",
      "To help consumers in making more sustainable choices, we are continuing steadily to roll out the Eco-score we launched in 2021. This sustainability label is linked to a unique, low-entry threshold points saving programme that allows customers\n",
      "to support great ecological initiatives. And we are pleased to report that international manufacturers are also starting to apply the Eco-score to their A-brand products.\n",
      "We continued to invest in our in-house production and in our own agricultural land, which we make available to independent farmers on a long-term basis, with part of it earmarked for innovative, more sustainable crops.\n",
      "We expect a first harvest of Belgian mussels from our sea farm in summer 2023, for sale in our Cru markets. At the end of 2022, we announced our ambition to make our freight transport completely emission-free by 2035 by switching to battery and hydrogen-electric vehicles. In the meantime, we\n",
      "have already commissioned various electric vehicles, including one 44-tonne truck and five refrigerated trucks.\n",
      "We feel confirmed in the sustainable course we have been following for a number of years now, including the success\n",
      "of our very first Green Retail Bond. With it, we easily raised the intended 250 million euros to finance existing and new sustainable projects in the coming years.\n",
      "In the past financial year, we have taken many steps to ensure the sustainable continued existence of our group. Spring 2023 saw some important internal changes. General manager of Colruyt Lowest Prices Chris Van Wettere went into well-\n",
      "deserved retirement, and a milestone also followed for myself. On 1 July 2023, I handed over the day-to-day management of Colruyt Group to Stefan Goethaert, who has been the new CEO since then. Stefan combines strong international management experience with the required leadership skills and a values- driven vision. Timing and preparation are right: together we came through both the corona crisis and the shock wave of the war in Ukraine. We have taken important structural and organisational decisions and our strategy for the next few years is clear and under implementation. The day-to-day management and future of Colruyt Group are in good hands with Stefan and his executive committee, while I also remain closely involved as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n",
      "Finally I want to extend my sincere thanks to all employees, customers and partners who, with their continued trust in Colruyt Group even in difficult times, are today building the future with us.\n",
      "Jef Colruyt\n",
      "CEO Colruyt Group\n",
      "Who\n",
      "are we?\n",
      "A family business\n",
      "Colruyt Group is a family business that has grown over three generations into a retail group with over 33.000 employees and a diverse portfolio of food and non-food formats, in Belgium and abroad. The biggest activity remains our supermarket Colruyt, which has delivered on\n",
      "its brand promise of “Lowest Prices” day after day for 50 years. Over the last half a century, we have diversified our activities substantially. However, we remain true to retail, which still accounts for four fifths of our revenue. Today, we are active in retail with around ten business formats, with both physical outlets and online shops in Belgium, Luxembourg and France.\n",
      "In addition, we operate in foodservice and wholesale, for instance as a dedicated partner for the independent Spar stores. In recent years, we have also grown strongly as a producer and supplier of renewable wind and solar energy. Finally, it is typical of Colruyt Group that we continue to do many things ourselves. We possess a wealth of experience and expertise in areas such as technology, IT and communication, as well as production and packaging of meat, coffee, cheese and wine, for example.\n",
      "Complementary brands, shared values\n",
      "At Colruyt Group, we want to make a positive difference with everything we do.\n",
      "At every stage of life and at all important moments in our customers’ lives, we want to be there for them in a suitable way. For this reason, we aim for maximum complementarity between our different brands. One by one, they differentiate themselves with simple solutions for specific requirements. Each in their own, authentic way, our brands express the ‘simplicity in retail’ that we represent as Colruyt Group. In this way, each brand helps achieve our common mission. Each business format also embodies the same group values. Together, they form the\n",
      "foundation on which we continue to build as a group and a point of reference in this rapidly changing world. For ourselves, for our partners and for our customers. So they all know what they can expect of us, and that creates trust in turn.\n",
      "Working towards our goals\n",
      "In stormy times, it is the roots that determine how firmly our tree stands. The fruits on our tree are our results. But results are merely a consequence. They merely tell us something about how we performed in a given context. That’s why, at Colruyt Group, we don’t focus on results but on goals. That means setting a goal and doing the right thing towards it in the here and now. We are focussed, have confidence in our own ability and hope for the best possible outcome. Not by concentrating on the fruits, but by staying focussed on our orchard and looking after our ‘terroir’.\n",
      "Firm roots\n",
      "Knowing where you come from helps you understand where you are going. At Colruyt Group, we greatly value the insights and experience that three generations of entrepreneurship have brought us. We know who we are, what we stand for together, we appreciate our own strengths, identity and culture. In this way, we manage to keep a family atmosphere and an SME attitude, as a company that now has more than\n",
      "33.000 employees.\n",
      "Faith in people\n",
      "At Colruyt Group, we always start with a positive view of people. We believe in people’s creative power to see and seize opportunities. We assume that every employee is driven to deliver quality and can add something to the greater whole. So, we do all we can to allow our employees’ natural life energy to flow as effectively as possible. That stimulates their entrepreneurship and growth, in their craft and as people. After all, as the people grow, our company will grow. Our positive view of people stems from a wider, more positive worldview and our optimistic\n",
      "nature. We are convinced that through our enterprise, we help build a world in which we all want to live. Step by step, together with colleagues, customers and partners.\n",
      "Common purpose\n",
      "Our group mission is to channel the creative power of our people.That is our shared ‘why’. At Colruyt Group we want to:\n",
      "Create sustainable added value together through value-driven craftsmanship in retail.\n",
      "Driven by values\n",
      "At Colruyt Group, we identify nine core attitudes that we consider valuable in helping us realise our mission. They have grown historically and capture the essence of what we all stand for. These values form, so to speak, the roots that feed our tree and determine who we are. Our values inspire us and give meaning to what we do. But they only ‘live’ insofar as we actually apply them in our everyday work. In order to focus\n",
      "on that, at Colruyt Group we also link nine focus points to our values. These help us act consistently and authentically.\n",
      "Our strategy\n",
      "To be able to fulfil our mission, we have developed a long-term strategy and formulated clear ambitions and objectives. The common thread is and remains that we want to do business sustainably and at the same time facilitate conscious consumption, as a strong and constantly innovative local player.\n",
      "Our starting point at all times is our customers and their evolving needs, including greater control over their budgets, their desire to live healthier and more sustainable lives, their need for greater convenience, or the right offer at the right time.\n",
      "We intend to meet these needs in three ways. We want to make our customers’ lives easier with relevant, simple solutions (Simplify), offer them opportunities to make more (environmentally) conscious choices (Empower) and to connect more with each other, society and our company (Connect).\n",
      "To be truly relevant in our customers’ lives, we offer them products and services in four areas: food, health and well-being, non-food and energy. In these areas, we are active with a wide range of complementary brands, together representing around a quarter of an average household budget.\n",
      "We are keen to accumulate further specialist skills in these areas of expertise in the coming years, and continue to grow. In each area of expertise, we group several brands and\n",
      "activities, so as to manage them in a targeted and professional manner. Of course, we will seek strong cooperation across these areas of expertise and develop synergies to offer our customers optimal solutions. Our Xtra app is enabling us\n",
      "to know our customers ever better, and therefore tailor our offering even closer to their needs.\n",
      "To give more concrete form to our ambitions and objectives, we have formulated four strategic changes, on which we will be focusing strongly in the coming years.\n",
      "Being the most cost-efficient retailer, in our stores, logistics and support services, by focusing on economies of scale, automation and digitalisation. In this way, we can offer a high-quality, correctly priced basic range on a permanent basis.\n",
      "Being a ‘phygital’ retailer, in which the physical and the digital reinforce each other. Using data to lead the way in online shopping.\n",
      "Being the best retailer for our customers, through skills excellence in all our activities.\n",
      "Growing further by responding to opportunities for new synergies and commercial formats, including in city concepts, in France and Luxembourg, in B2B, in digital business, etc.\n",
      "To bring these changes to a successful conclusion, we will continue to focus, among other things, on committed and skilled employees, strong leadership and an agile organisation. Naturally, true to our mission, we want to continue to create added value in a value-driven, economically sustainable manner, with respect for people and the environment.\n",
      "Raw materials\n",
      "Sustainability right across the value chain\n",
      "As a retailer with our own production departments, we have an impact throughout the entire supply chain. With this come many opportunities to make our activities more sustainable. We are committed to innovation and collaboration to continuously reduce our ecological footprint, based as far as possible on scientific methodologies. Moreover, our unique position in the chain enables us to connect the various partners in it, to inspire them and to act as a driver for a sustainable evolution.\n",

      "Use\n",
      "Sales\n",
      "Processing\n",
      "Transport\n",
      "Raw materials. As a retailer, we use our economic drive to stimulate positive social, environmental and animal-friendly practices at the producers, farmers and suppliers from whom we purchase our raw materials and products.\n",
      "Processing. Our goal is to both reduce the environmental footprint of our products and increase our positive social impact. We are also working to improve the nutritional values of our private-label products.\n",
      "Transport. We organise our goods transport as efficiently and safely as possible, with respect for the environment and our neighbours.\n",
      "Sales. We are always looking for the most sustainable solutions for keeping our products cool, for energy consumption in our stores, for customer and employee mobility, and more.\n",
      "Use of products. With ‘Step by step’, we inform and activate our customers towards consciously making more sustainable choices.\n",
      "Recycling/re-use. Following the principles of the circular economy, we want to reuse, upgrade or recycle the residual flows of our products and packaging as much as possible.\n",
      "Our approach to sustainable business\n",
      "Client\n",
      "12 programmes to make a difference\n",
      "3 drivers on which we organise ourselves\n",
      "Our sustainability policy is guided by three drivers. To start with: our products and services, the core of our activity as a retailer.\n",
      "A second driver is the infrastructure we use to bring those products and services to our customers. People are our third driving force. We implement our sustainability projects together with our employees, our business partners, our customers, our investors, knowledge institutions, governments, sector federations and other social organisations.\n",
      "With the Sustainability Domain and the Domain Board as overarching bodies, our organisational structure guarantees an ecosystem in which sustainability is deeply rooted.\n",
      "to make a difference\n",
      "In our sustainability strategy, we focus on a number of themes. These form our 12 sustainability programmes. For each programme, we believe we can achieve a concrete positive impact, in every link of the chain. The term ‘programme’ indicates that our work is never finished: once we achieve our goals, we set new ambitions. In this way, over time we achieve more than we ever thought possible.\n",
      "17 Sustainable Development Goals to report on\n",
      "Our efforts for a more sustainable world align seamlessly with the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Together they form a common sustainability agenda with concrete objectives, not only for society, the economy and the environment, but also for human rights and world peace. As an ‘SDG Voice’, we attach great importance to this ambitious agenda, because it offers us:\n",
      "an external view of what sustainability entails and can entail,\n",
      "a common language to use with external stakeholders,\n",
      "and a common base from which to tackle a whole range of societal challenges.\n",
      "We use the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as a compass for our sustainability strategy and a reporting framework for our achievements.\n",
      "Materiality analysis to determine our focus points\n",
      "Where do we have the most impact?\n",
      "Sustainability goes a long way. To determine our focus points, we performed a materiality analysis in March 2022. The term ‘materiality’ indicates how important or ‘material’ a certain sustainability theme is for an organisation and its stakeholders. Themes that score high on both axes of a so-called ‘materiality matrix’ are close to the heart of both the organisation and stakeholders. It is these themes where as a company you can have the greatest impact.\n",
      "This financial year, we use last year’s materiality matrix as our baseline. We shall prepare a new matrix in the 2024/25 financial year. In this way, we keep our finger on the pulse.\n",
      "Three-dimensional materiality matrix\n",
      "Our materiality matrix on p. 21 is the visual representation of three dimensions.\n",
      "First dimension (the vertical y-axis): based on international frameworks (GRI, SASB, SDGs) and our own sustainability strategy, we selected 21 topics where we as a company can make a difference. We asked 355 stakeholders which topics have the highest priority for them. We plotted these results on the vertical axis.\n",
      "Second dimension (the horizontal x-axis): Colruyt Group’s impact on the environment and society. Based on input from recognised sources like SASB, MSCI and GRI, we analysed the risks and opportunities in the retail sector. We plotted these results on the horizontal axis.\n",
      "Third dimension (the size of the circles): the financial impact of the topics on Colruyt Group. With this, we comply with the principle of double materiality: we weigh both the impact by our business and the impact on our company.\n",
      "7 material sustainability topics and 6 respective SDGs\n",
      "The result is a matrix that shows how ‘material’ each topic is for Colruyt Group. Highest-scoring topics are healthy products, product safety and quality, working conditions in the chain, emissions, energy management, responsible sourcing and fair and sustainable trade. We link these seven material topics to the matching Sustainable Development Goals, our chosen framework for reporting on our achievements.\n",
      "We also report on SDG 6 – Clean water and sanitation given the importance we attach to this in our business strategy.\n",
      "We will of course continue to focus on the other SDGs. For example, we consider Peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) and Partnerships for the goals (SDG 17) as levers for reaching all the other SDGs. We work closely with our partners and suppliers, always with mutual respect and on the basis of dialogue and trust.\n",

To efficiently achieve these objectives, we classify them according to our three drivers: product, infrastructure and people.\n",
      "The environment and society are the common thread running through our objectives:\n",
      "In the ecological area, we intend to reduce our environmental footprint as much as possible and promote the circularity of raw materials, materials and products. Our products are responsible for 95% of our environmental impact. So we can make a big difference here.\n",

      "retail activities, to our customers. We hope that our new objectives will also inspire others and are convinced that collaboration is the key to creating a lasting positive impact.\n",

      "The financial year 2022/23 was marked by a challenging macroeconomic context with high inflation, substantial cost increases and a negative business and consumer confidence.\n",
      "This context translates into a 7,7% increase of the Colruyt Group revenue (7,4% excluding fuels and 6,9% excluding fuels and Newpharma). The revenue increase is mainly driven by inflation, partially offset by lower volumes. The Belgian retail market is characterised by volume declines in food stores and high competitiveness. In this context, Colruyt Lowest Prices continues to consistently implement its lowest price strategy. This implies that Colruyt Group has not been able\n",
      "to fully pass on cost price inflation to the customer, bringing down the gross profit margin.\n",
      "In addition, today’s context causes Colruyt Group’s operating expenses to increase markedly. This increase is mainly attributable to rising inflation, with a large impact on energy, transport costs and employee benefit expenses. The latter are heavily impacted by Belgium’s automatic wage indexation system. The group succeeded in limiting the increase in operating expenses in part through an increased focus on cost control and (energy) efficiency.\n",
      "Impairment charges rose by EUR 27 million to\n",
      "EUR 33 million. This is mainly due to the valuation of\n",
      "tangible and intangible fixed assets related to the loss- making operations of Dreamland and Dreambaby.\n",
      "This results in a decrease of the group’s operating profit and net result to, respectively, EUR 279 million (2,6% of revenue) and EUR 201 million (1,9% of revenue) in 2022/23.\n",
      "In October 2022, Colruyt Group further increased its stake in Newpharma from 61 to 100%. Since then, Newpharma has been fully consolidated (period from October to December 2022). This has contributed to the consolidated revenue. The impact on the operating profit and the net result is limited.\n",
      "Colruyt Group’s investments amounted to EUR 463 million in the financial year 2022/23 (4,3% of revenue) and related mainly to new stores and the modernisation of existing stores, to the expansion of logistics capacity in Belgium and France, to innovation and digital transformation\n",

Revenue was positively impacted by the revenue increase from the fuel distribution activities of DATS 24 (excluding petrol, revenue improved by 7,4%), the full consolidation of Roelandt Group and Newpharma and increased food inflation. On the other hand, revenue evolution was negatively affected by the declining volumes.\n",

As a retailer and as the market leader, Colruyt Group continues to fulfil its role in society, whereby customers can count on the group to help them stay on top of their household budgets. This implies that Colruyt Group has not been able to fully pass on cost price inflation to the customer.\n",
      "Net operating expenses climbed from 20,0% to 20,8% of revenue. This significant increase is mainly attributable to rising inflation, with a large impact on energy costs, transport costs and employee benefit expenses.

Depreciation and amortisation charges rose by EUR 15 million, mainly as a result of the continuous investments in stores, distribution and production centres and transformation programmes.

      "In a highly competitive market environment, food retail revenue increased by 6,6%. This increase is a result of food inflation and the full consolidation of Roelandt Group in January 2022, partially offset by volume declines in food stores.\n",
      "As from this financial year, the online revenue of Dreamland and Dreambaby is reported in the non-food retail revenue section, regardless of which store realised the revenue. As a result, the related comparative figures have been reclassified.\n",
      "Revenue of Colruyt Lowest Prices in Belgium and Luxembourg increased by 6,9% for the reasons mentioned above. Colruyt Lowest Prices continues to consistently implement its lowest prices strategy and delivers on its commitment to its customers day after day. This implies that Colruyt Group has not been able to fully pass on cost price inflation to the customer.\n",

Okay’s store network expanded with three stores in the financial year 2022/23, while the renewed store concept was rolled out in several stores. In addition, a second Okay Direct was opened, which targets an audience that wants to shop faster, also outside traditional opening hours and on Sundays.

As a result, the related comparative figures have been reclassified.\n",
      "Despite their leading market positions, Dreamland and Dreambaby are experiencing de-creasing volumes with a substantial negative impact on their profitability. This is the result of the challenging markets in which both non- food activities operate and is strengthened by the current\n",

Over the past months, several corrective measures have been taken to allow Dreamland and Dreambaby to consolidate their market position and become profitable in a sustainable way. The online assortment of Dreamland has been reviewed recently, as have the delivery rates for online orders. Colruyt Group believes additional measures are necessary for Dreamland and Dreambaby to progress to-wards a healthy, sustainable future. In April 2023, the management informed the works council of its intention to restructure Dreamland and Dreambaby (which together form one technical business unit). The execution of this plan would have an impact on the employment whereby the Procedure Renault with regard to collective redundancies would be applied.\n",

Furthermore, this transaction is expected to result in a limited one-off impact on the net result of the financial year 2023/24. Both are subject to the customary post-closing purchase price adjustments. Additionally, certain assets have been transferred from Colruyt Group for a total\n",

      "The financial year 2023/24 will include several one-off effects:\n",

The final price can still vary depending on the exact closing date but is expected to amount to at least EUR 1,55 billion (net of debt) at the level of Virya Energy.\n",

      "a physical component on the one hand (stores, distribution centres, etc.) and are inter-connected by a digital component on the other (Xtra). Colruyt Group has the ambition to continue to grow, gain further expert knowledge and provide a sustainable offering in each of those four areas of expertise in the years to come. This will enable the group to create sustainable added value for the customer, provide them the best possible service and re-spond to their needs.\n",
      "To provide more clarity and boost our strength and effectiveness as a group, the legal structure will be adapted to be better aligned with these four areas of expertise. This led to the establishment of Virya Energy NV in late 2019 and the recent integration of DATS 24 NV into Virya Energy NV with a view to centralising the energy activities of the group. Also, the non-food activities of the group were centralised under the\n",
      "entity Darzana NV in April 2022. The activities related to ‘Health\n",
      "and Well-being’ were centralised under the entity Sukhino NV at the end of March 2023. Further changes to the legal structure will be im-plemented in the coming months. The food retail activities of Etn. Fr. Colruyt NV will be transferred to a separate subsidiary and the activities of the listed parent company will be structured with a focus on a wide range of service and group support activities, which include but are not limited to private label management, strategy development, HR policy, customer services, financing activities and technical support.\n",
      "Eventually all Colruyt Group activities will be centralised by area of expertise - ‘Food’, ‘Health and Well-being’, ‘Non-Food’ and ‘Energy’. The parent company will serve all these areas of expertise and connect them with each other in order to create and exploit synergies, ensure smooth and efficient management and achieve the group’s long-term objectives.\n",

      "France\n",
      "Colruyt Lowest Prices is primarily aimed at families who do their weekly shopping in a price-conscious way. It is also the ideal format for professionals, associations and households doing big shopping in an efficient way. Colruyt has a wide range, a considerably expanded butcher’s section and fresh food department. Day after day, the store chain guarantees its customers the lowest prices for national brands as well as the Boni Selection and Everyday private labels. Is a product cheaper elsewhere nearby? Colruyt immediately lowers its price.\n",
      "On top of this, the formula offers its own promotions and responds to all competitors’ promotions, both nationally and regionally.\n",
      "Colruyt prioritises simplicity, efficiency and readiness to serve.\n",
      "Rising revenue and market share\n",
      "During the past financial year, Colruyt Lowest Prices recorded a considerable increase in revenue, driven mainly by food price inflation and an influx of new customers.\n",
      "In the first half of the year, inflation-driven revenue continued to be impacted by promotional pressure, which subsequently weakened somewhat. Summer sales were moderate, partly because families started travelling again. The football World Cup in November and December\n",
      "generated a slight increase in revenue. Year-end sales were successful, with families more often celebrating at home and able more easily than ever to find inspiration for budget-friendly dining at Colruyt.\n",
      "In a shrinking Belgian retail market, Colruyt’s sales volumes also fell, albeit relatively less sharply. Customers visited stores more frequently, but with on average smaller shopping baskets and to a certain extent choosing\n",
      "budget-friendly own brands over national brands.\n",
      "Spiking energy and food prices increased consumer price awareness. In a context of persistent food price inflation, Colruyt could attract many new customers from autumn 2022 onwards, which benefited its market share.\n",
      "Colruyt continued at all times to keep its promise of guaranteeing the lowest prices to consumers. In this way purchasing, energy, wage and other costs were not fully passed on in the selling prices, as a result of which the margins fell slightly.\n",
      "Colruyt continues to expand steadily, with 1 to 2 new branches every year and a dozen renovated stores, often with expanded sales areas.\n",
      "Simpler pricing display\n",
      "In May 2022, Colruyt simplified its price display format, on paper, online and on the electronic price labels on the shelves. All prices are now marked ‘black and white’, including reduced prices in response to competitors. Own promotions are in red, and marked as ‘Promotion/Actie’. This makes it even clearer\n",
      "to customers that they can always count on the lowest prices and often additional discounts.\n",
      "This simplified price indication is also in line with new European legislation, which applies in Belgium since June 2022.\n",
      "Putting our money on B2B\n",
      "Colruyt has many professional customers like catering companies and resellers.\n",
      "With their loyalty cards, they can count on wholesale prices in all Colruyt stores, as well as in two target-group-oriented Colruyt Professionals stores. With both Brussels stores now doing well, Colruyt is keen to extend the cash&carry concept in other major cities.\n",
      "The wholesale service has started using a new CRM software package that enables employees to communicate more smoothly and, above all, to serve their customers and prospects better and more proactively.\n",
      "Lowest costs\n",
      "Colruyt fulfils its promise of lowest prices by working efficiently and focusing on lowest costs, for example with sober shop fittings, energy-efficient freezers and fully loaded trucks. This year additional efforts were made.\n",
      "Due to rising energy costs, the well-known flaps at the entrances to the refrigerated sections returned. They represent a saving of 2,3 million euros on the annual energy bill.\n",
      "Initial tests with technical innovations that provide attractive time savings, like Easy Check-out for the checkout process and Product Finder for in-store work.\n",
      "No more paper post for store employees, who receive all communications on their personal smartphones. At group level, this represents an annual savings of\n",
      "273.000 euros.\n",
      "Efficiency and ergonomics go hand in hand\n",
      "In a changing world, we at Colruyt Group attach great importance to versatility, as well as to being healthy and enjoying coming to work. That is why Colruyt is accelerating its investments in technology that makes work in the store more efficient and more pleasant. For example, personal smartphones are getting more and more new functionalities. This saves employees a lot of running back and forth, they can help customers quickly and communicate smoothly with colleagues and central services.\n",
      "Less searching\n",
      "Saving up to an hour and a half every day on shelf-stocking is possible using the Product Finder application that connects store employees’ smartphones to the electronic price labels. Anyone scanning a product will see its price label light up and immediately find the right place in the shelf. Less searching makes life quite a bit easier for store employees. Colruyt started testing the internally developed technology at the end of 2022 and plans to introduce it in all stores in the second half of 2023.\n",
      "Smoother checkout process\n",
      "Easy Check-out is an intelligent camera system above the cash register that automatically scans all barcoded products. In this way, the cashier no longer needs a hand scanner and can hold the products with both hands. This speeds up the checkout process by up to a fifth and is ergonomically better for employees. The internally developed system has been tested since February 2023 and will be installed in a first phase in 60 stores.\n",
      "Back-saving work\n",
      "Together with the Belgian start-up SpineWise, a new technology was tested that sensitises store employees to working more ergonomically. Sensors on work clothing emit vibration signals enabling employees to correct overly stressful positions. In tests in two stores, up to 30% less back-straining movements were observed.\n",
      "Continually adapted assortment\n",
      "Colruyt continuously adapts its ranges to respond to customers’ changing needs.\n",
      "More products from more sustainable Belgian agricultural chains with an eye for animal welfare, soil health, biodiversity, etc. Collaboration with 330 dairy farmers, 185 cattle farmers, 17 chicken breeders, 17 potato growers, 6 organic pig breeders, 3 fruit growers … We indirectly purchase products from around 6.000 Belgian farms.\n",
      "Almost all stores now have a parapharmacy shelf, with products for first aid, skin care and colds. In the meantime, customers can easily find their way to the shelf, compiled with advice from our Newpharma online pharmacy.\n",
      "With 35 new items, Colruyt already offers some hundred non-alcoholic alternatives. Sales volumes of non- alcoholic drinks are increasing year on year, especially in beers, followed by aperitifs, ready-to-drink mocktails and\n",
      "More than 120 fresh vegetarian products and about\n",

      "Collect&Go has been the market leader in the Belgian online food market for over 20 years. Customers reserve items from the Colruyt and Bio-Planet ranges via the website or app. Staff in the stores and the Londerzeel and Erpe-Mere e-distribution centres carefully select the best products and prepare the order. Customers reserving before midnight can collect their groceries the next day from more than 220 collection points at Colruyt, Okay, Bio-Planet or standalone.\n",
      "The online shopping service stands for quality, reliability, expertise and personal service.\n",
      "Sustainable business model\n",
      "In an e-commerce market under pressure, market leader Collect&Go proved that\n",
      "its business model is sustainable and profitable. Even post-covid, turnover remained more than fifty percent higher than before the pandemic.\n",
      "The average basket continued to rise throughout the financial year, in line with rising inflation. Attractively priced products were also ordered in larger quantities. 23 December was again\n",
      "a record day, with no fewer than 25,000 orders\n",
      "The number of active customers remained stable, as did the number of customers who only shop online with our group. Only the order frequency decreased, as customers started combining online ordering with physical shopping after the corona period.\n",
      "At the beginning of 2023, the variable service cost was introduced, whereby collections and deliveries during peak times became 1 euro more expensive. This intervention to better spread the workload and maintain a high service level met expectations. Customers can still enjoy numerous interesting promotions that eliminate the service cost.\n",
      "To further broaden the customer base and strengthen loyalty, Collect&Go wants to diversify its offering with more services in addition to large-scale weekly grocery shopping. For example, the meal boxes from partner Foodbag will also be available from Collect&Go from mid-2023.\n",
      "Second Walk-in collection point\n",
      "A Collect&Go Walk-in opened in Saint-Gilles, the second collection point after Ixelles, geared to a city public that comes to shop on foot, by bicycle or scooter. On an area of barely 25 m², the Walk-in makes the large range and all the benefits of Colruyt Lowest Prices and Bio-Planet accessible in the heart of the city.\n",
      "Although half of the customers arrive without cars, the value of the shopping baskets is easily two to three times that of a typical neighbourhood store.\n",
      "The new Walk-in shares a building with an Okay Compact, enabling customers to combine their collections with smaller grocery purchases.\n",
      "With this formula, Collect&Go gets to know the urban consumer well and succeeds\n",
      "in attracting new customers and quickly building up loyalty. More Walk-ins are planned in the metropolitan area.\n",

      "to know the shopping service in a relaxed way.\n",
      "Unmanned delivery\n",
      "Collect&Go continues to focus on sustainable innovation. At the beginning of 2023, an unmanned vehicle delivered orders to a few customers’ homes in Londerzeel. Using a code, customers could take their groceries from\n",
      "the vehicle and return empty boxes or empties. The successful test in collaboration with our Smart Technics innovation hub opens up perspectives for innovative, sustainable ways of delivering groceries in urban areas,\n",
      "in consultation with the competent authorities that shape the regulatory framework.\n",
      "Increasing capacity\n",
      "The Londerzeel and Erpe-Mere distribution centres prepare more than a quarter of all orders for shipment to the collection points. Together, they offer the potential to significantly increase capacity in the coming years, especially by using more surface area and by focusing on automation. In Londerzeel, for example, the picking of fresh products will be supported by autonomously driving pick-up carts from mid-2023.\n",
      "For 25 years already, Okay has been the handy neighbourhood discounter where customers can do their daily shopping quickly, inexpensively and conveniently. The easily accessible shops are conveniently arranged, with a complete range of daily shopping products within a limited space. Okay is strong in high-quality ultra-fresh products, especially fruit and vegetables, meat, ready-to-eat meals and bread baked on site. The store format stands for a warm welcome, guarantees the lowest prices in the neighbourhood and inspires its customers with simplicity and convenience.\n",
      "Okay Compact has been the format for fast, cheap and easy city centre shopping since 2012.\n",
      "Okay Direct is the 24/7 automatic self-service shop where customers also do their daily shopping outside normal opening hours.\n",
      "Attractive sales growth\n",
      "After a difficult start to the financial year, Okay achieved a more than decent sales growth, especially in the second half of the year, driven on the one hand by rising inflation.\n",
      "On the other hand, there was a successful end-of-year sales campaign, including ready-made party menus and individual caterer dishes. The first quarter of 2023 was also good, thanks in part to the enthusiastically received promo policy with strong 1+1 offers and despite stabilising inflation. This resulted in strong customer growth and increased shopping frequency. This allowed Okay to keep its market share stable\n",
      "in a shrinking retail market, despite the slightly lower volumes and smaller shopping baskets.\n",
      "Okay expects its increased focus on price advantage to further drive sales in the coming financial year, as will the activation campaign marking the format’s 25th anniversary.\n",
      "Okay remains the format that stands for the fastest and most convenient shopping in the market, in combination with its ‘lowest price in the area’ positioning and a high degree of customer friendliness. With the chain focused on popular, fast-rotating items, customers can also be sure of high product availability.\n",
      "Armed with these trump cards, the chain sees potential for at least 250 outlets in Belgium. The group is keen to accelerate growth of the Okay and Okay Compact formats, with a focus on Ghent, Antwerp and Brussels and the central cities. Supporting this expansion, the group will invest in the coming financial year in expanding the distribution centre, with a focus on urban and ultra-fresh ranges.\n",
      "With electronic price labels now rolled out in all stores, employees can focus even more on their core tasks and planning can be done more efficiently.\n",

      "Scan and pay for your groceries yourself, with a shop assistant nearby for any assistance. That is the aim of the ‘Assisted self-check-out’, a hybrid cash register system consisting of self-scan stations and two manned checkout tills. The goal is to greatly reduce customer checkout waiting times. Checkout working hours also reduce, to the benefit of the store organisation. The system has been tested since February 2023 and installed in a dozen stores in the course of the year.\n",
      "Expanding self-service concept\n",
      "Okay Direct is the innovative self-service concept where customers shop completely autonomously, around the clock, thanks to technology from our Smart Technics innovation department.\n",
      "At the end of 2021, the first 150 m² store with around 600 items, tailored to an urban public, opened in downtown Ghent. The concept is meeting expectations and in 2022 was awarded the prestigious Mercurius Prize of the Comeos trade federation.\n",
      "Okay believes in this perfectly scalable concept and will roll it out further in various variants and contexts. For example, at the beginning of 2023, a barely 21 m² mobile sales unit was installed next to the Okay store in Lennik, as an additional 24/7 out-of-city solution. Starting in autumn 2023, the concept will be further tested in an urban environment.\n",

      "with a range of quality meat, cheese and vegetarian products and preparations.\n",
      "Under its ‘Truly good’ motto, Bio-Planet inspires its customers to eat, enjoy and live consciously. In the stores, skilled employees advise and assist customers. Bio-Planet is a pioneer in product sustainability, working closely with growers and producers. It also makes maximum use of sustainable materials and technologies in its store premises\n",
      "New stores even more sustainable\n",
      "In March 2023, the 33rd store opened in Tournai, the third in the new store concept, with even more focus on sustainability, a focus that will be applied in renovations in the coming years. Some firsts:\n",
      "Even more bulk products, in anticipation of future legislation. In addition to fruit and vegetables, these include nuts, cereals and dried fruits, sweet and salty snacks, origin coffee beans... Customers can also have their own jars filled at the service counter.\n",
      "Biological purification plant that purifies waste water for reuse, like for flushing toilets or cleaning the store.\n",
      "Heat recovery. With heat from the cooling installation reused to heat the building, no fossil fuels are needed.\n",
      "Difficult financial year\n",
      "In a shrinking European organic market with a decreasing offering of organic products, Bio-Planet’s revenue also declined for the second year in a row, largely as a result of the successive crises. In this difficult context, customers pared spending and shopping trips, with new customers arriving only in dribs and drabs. In the first quarter of 2023, sales started to pick up again, mainly driven by the most\n",
      "loyal customers.\n",
      "The fall in revenue, combined with increased remuneration and energy costs, had an effect on profitability.\n",
      "The competitively priced Boni Bio private label with approximately 330 references remains a crucial starter that keeps organic accessible to everyone.\n",
      "Bio-Planet remains by far the largest chain among pure organic stores and continues to expand its store park, with a first store in Luxembourg possibly opening in the coming financial year. At the same time, the chain is taking a number of structural actions to make its activities profitable.\n",

      "Structural actions\n",
      "Online reservations via Collect&Go can only be picked up in Bio-Planet stores, no longer in 130 Colruyt stores. This saves on transport costs. In addition, the online shopping service was able to attract new customers, with online orders weighing about half more than the average offline shopping basket.\n",
      "Reduction of the number of items from 6.000 to 5.000, with room for 500 seasonal products. Throughout the year slow-rotating products are taken faster off the shelf.\n",
      "Intolerance advice\n",
      "Bio-Planet’s INTO mailing programme supports consumers with food intolerances. Registered consumers received four weekly test emails with inspiration for a gluten- or lactose-free life and a selection from the wide range of suitable products. In the meantime, about a thousand people have already subscribed to the monthly newsletter, including many new customers.\n",
      "Innovative burgers\n",
      "Bio-Planet has developed three innovative burgers with less meat and more vegetables, legumes\n",
      "or mushrooms, which still match the taste and mouthfeel of classic burgers. That makes it easy for everyone to eat more vegetable proteins and contribute to the protein shift.\n",

      "The Seaweed Company, a sustainable company in which the group participates. The chicken burger contains leftover of oyster mushrooms that\n",
      "Bio-Planet has grown on bread waste from the shops, making it a perfectly circular product.\n",
      "The number of deliveries to stores fell from five to four a week, sufficient to keep shelves nicely filled.\n",
      "At the beginning of 2023, the paper folders were replaced with an online version, saving printing and postage costs and permitting faster responses with last-minute promotions.\n",
      "More pre-packaged products on offer, especially in cheese and salads. This reduces waste and shortens customer waiting times.\n",
      "Cru is a multi-experience market, for people who are passionate about food. Cru brings together ten artisan specialities under a single roof, offering a unique selection of fruit and vegetables, meat and charcuterie, fish and poultry, as well as cheeses, drinks, chocolate, sourdough bread and flowers.\n",
      "Cru follows the rhythm of the seasons with authentic, ‘ordinary’ pure-tasting products of exceptional quality, in close cooperation\n",
      "with selected producer partners. Expert staff present the products in their purest form, ready to cook or pre-prepared.\n",
      "Customers can taste the products at their leisure in the market, and enjoy breakfast, drinks, lunch and coffee in the adjacent Cuit eateries (Ghent and Overijse). They can pick up webshop orders in the market or have them delivered to their homes.\n",
      "Recovery after a difficult year\n",
      "Cru experienced a slight decrease in revenue, due mainly to the crisis context, lower consumer confidence and stronger price awareness, as well as the again increasing number of restaurant visits. This translated into more modest shopping baskets and more spaced-out store visits. Sales picked up again from the first quarter of 2023 onwards.\n",
      "Cru has continued to attract new customers, responding to the demand for quality over quantity and for pure, authentic products with a story, even in uncertain times.\n",
      "The year-end period was once again a success, with Cru remaining top of mind for party shopping, even if staff shortages presented challenges in the Christmas run-up. The Cuit eatery in Overijse was closed for several months due to road works.\n",
      "The understaffing reduced personnel costs. Operating costs, on the other hand, rose due to the start-up of Cru Dilbeek, IT investments and spiking energy expenditure.\n",
      "Quality and innovation\n",
      "Cru is known among its customers for the quality of\n",
      "its products. Indeed, many regular customers invariably buy bread, meat, vegetables and fruit every time they visit.\n",
      "The interaction with like-minded partner-suppliers brings craftspersons together to create new, unique products or recipes that do justice to the pure flavours.\n",
      "Within Colruyt Group, Cru often plays the role of\n",
      "innovator and tester, for both technology and products.\n",
      "First on the market with Belgian apricots and, for the second year in a row, fresh Belgian ginger, now with derivatives such as jam and sirup.\n",
      "Introduction of drinking broths and a wider range of premium non-alcoholic drinks.\n",
      "Next financial year, the first Belgian premium mussels and even more variation in the range, in tune with the seasons and in response to new trends.\n",
      "Optimisations\n",
      "Cru continues to focus on operational efficiency and profitability at store level. Additional\n",
      "steps have been taken to save costs and at the same time to serve customers even more attentively. More effort was put into increasing craftsmanship and optimising purchasing, logistics, waste management and other processes.\n",
      "Partial cutting and pre-package of processed meats by an external partner: less waste than with cutting at the counter. The pre-packaged charcuterie is proving popular with customers.\n",
      "New personnel planning tool, supported by Colruyt Group IT: more efficient and flexible, lower administration and maintenance costs.\n",
      "Cashless shopping in Cru Dilbeek, previously rolled out in the Cuit eateries: more efficient and safer.\n",
      "Satisfied customers\n",
      "Like no other format, Cru can count on highly satisfied, loyal customers, with year-end orders scoring an average of 9 out of 10 in an online survey of customers who had ordered. Cru will focus even more on customer acquisition and retention, through investments in marketing, craftsmanship, entrepreneurship and market perception. For example, tastings where suppliers present their products and customer tours.\n",
      "Colruyt Prix Qualité is a clearly laid out and affordable neighbourhood supermarket where customers can find everything they need for their daily and weekly shopping. The stores offer the best value in the neighbourhood for a similar shopping cart, and are strong on fresh produce, meat, charcuterie and bread. Other\n",
      "strengths include the wine section and the growing range of organic, regional and local products.\n",
      "The stores are mainly located along approach roads in (semi-)rural areas and almost all of them have a Collect&Go collection point.\n",
      "About half also have a DATS 24 filling station, to support penetration in the region. The contribution of the filling stations is included in Colruyt Prix Qualité’s revenue.\n",
      "Slight growth on top of inflation\n",
      "Our French food retailer looks back with satisfaction on the past financial year. Revenue grew by more than 10%, partly due to expansion with 3 new stores and a remarkable growth and growing loyalty of the wider customer base. Half of the growth was driven by robust sales price inflation, which however only partially covered the higher purchase prices, putting margins under slight pressure.\n",
      "Inflation has led to a general shift in the French market, with smaller average shopping baskets and a larger share of cheaper brands. However, thanks to its favourable price positioning and perception and the quality of its product range, Colruyt was able to keep volume decreases and downshifting below the market average and succeeded in gaining local market share.\n",
      "Colruyt Prix Qualité enjoyed contractually agreed favourable\n",
      "Local anchoring\n",
      "Dole distribution centre operational\n",
      "Delivery of the new 25.000 m² distribution centre in Dole was slightly delayed, but costs remained under control as most contracts pre- dated the corona crisis. The hall for fast-rotating products opened\n",
      "as planned in mid-2023, with that for fresh products to follow in the autumn of 2023 .\n",
      "Together with the Gondreville site opened in 2021, the new DC significantly reduces the number of transport kilometres, ensures efficiency gains and permits further expansion.\n",
      "The planned office building in Dole has been postponed to 2026, allowing more resources to be focused on the logistics refurbishment. Moreover, the option of teleworking has made the need for extra office space less urgent.\n",
      "electricity rates for a long time, but these rose very significantly at the beginning of 2023, with a temporary adverse effect on profits. Thanks to a long-term agreement with our energy producer EuroWatt Energy, Colruyt is assured of more favourable electricity prices in the coming years.\n",
      "For the first time in three years, two well-attended wine fairs were organised, plus special in-store tasting evenings for loyal wine buyers.\n",
      "Colruyt believes in its growth potential and is pursuing its expansion plans. A fourth store was added in Alsace and another 3 to 4 are planned for the coming financial year.\n",
      "The Collect&Go online shopping service has maintained its revenue levels, and continues to invest in performance and ease of use.\n",
      "3 new stores: Horbourg-Wihr, Beuvillers and Bonnefamille\n",
      "In France, Colruyt traditionally supports many local initiatives. Since 2020, for example, it has had a partnership with the annual post-Tour de France cycling criterium in Dole. The initiative is a great success and has generated lots of goodwill among local authorities and residents.\n",
      "Lowest prices around\n",
      "As its name already promises, Colruyt Prix Qualité offers excellent value for money. For comparable products from national brands, it has the lowest prices in the immediate vicinity of the shops. By combining this price positioning with ‘proximité’ and ‘convivialité’ (customer-friendliness), Colruyt continues to occupy a unique position in the French retail market. The brand is considerably cheaper than the average local store and distinguishes itself from the hard discounters with, among other things, its wide range of national, regional and local brands.\n",
      "Multi-skilled employees\n",
      "In a tight labour market, it is not easy for Colruyt to find employees, especially for trades such as bakers or butchers. For this reason, the chain is starting to train its employees in a more multidisciplinary way and deploy them in multiple sectors. At the same time, the organisation is gearing itself more to the wishes of the younger generations, including flexible employment contracts and teleworking options.\n",
      "Colex (Colruyt Export) supplies retail and foodservice products to distributors, wholesalers and supermarkets all over the world, with a focus on the African continent and French Overseas Territories. The export department does especially well in Central and Western Africa, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo as its largest sales market. Colex does not have its own stores there, but works closely with local partners, using their distribution networks.\n",
      "Colex offers a wide range of groceries, fresh produce and frozen food under Colruyt Group’s own brands (like Everyday and Boni Selection), supplemented by a peripheral range of A-brands. The company stands out with its unique all-in export service and for the support it gives its customers in marketing the products.\n",
      "Strong growth in the Congo\n",
      "In the past financial year, Colex’s exports to the Democratic Republic of the Congo grew by more than half. Growth was stimulated by intensive marketing campaigns to promote\n",
      "Everyday as a leading European brand and ‘La marque préférée des Congolais’. In parallel,\n",
      "Colex worked hard to market Boni Selection more firmly as a premium brand with a very wide product range. Market research tells us that conscious Boni consumers are very satisfied with the quality and show exceptional brand loyalty, confirming the slogan ‘L’essayer c’est l’adopter’ (Trying is adopting).\n",

      "Turntable Senegal\n",
      "In West Africa, the focus is on Senegal, a highly competitive market where French retailers operate their own stores. There, Colex supports local mini-markets, wholesalers and neighbourhood shops in marketing its own brands. Sales in seven neighbouring countries are also managed out of Senegal.\n",
      "The Belgian meal box\n",
      "Foodbag, the thoroughly Belgian meal box distinguishes itself from the competition with quality products from local suppliers, flexible service and an eye to sustainability.\n",
      "Flexible. Each box contains a choice of three, four, five or six dishes, for one to five people.\n",
      "Customers order separate boxes or choose a weekly or biweekly subscription, which they can easily pause.\n",
      "Local. Close cooperation with local partners enables Foodbag to offer the best seasonal products from our own soil. Foodbag is transparent about their origin and presents some thirty suppliers on its website.\n",
      "Original. Every week customers have a choice of thirty dishes from our own chefs, in five cooking styles: from classic with a twist or vegetarian to cosmopolitan, nice and easy or ready-made.\n",
      "More choice,\n",
      "more convenience\n",
      "Foodbag continued its growth also after corona, started working even more intensively with local partners, and successfully completed the integration of the 15gram meal box brand.\n",
      "The range grew from 23 to 30 weekly dishes, with an additional thirty or so convenience items, such as bread, pizza, soup, drinks, fruit and cakes. A special loyalty system has been developed for loyal customers.\n",
      "Quality delivery\n",
      "Our own drivers deliver the refrigerated meal boxes to customer homes in Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia, from Friday to Monday. The boxes are also available in about twenty Collect&Go collection points.\n",
      "The company’s own delivery network grew to 80 vans and 150 drivers. To permit quality delivery, Foodbag often works with newly retired drivers.\n",
      "Foodbag tested electric delivery in core cities and home delivery to a hundred customers via smart locks.\n",
      "The most sustainable drinking water\n",
      "Robinetto sees its mission as providing as many people as possible with quality drinking water from the tap, a much more ecological and cheaper solution than bottled water. The company installs professional tap installations for delivering filtered, cooled, still and sparkling water,\n",
      "and in so doing relieves customers of disposing of masses of plastic waste. Robinetto today offers 40 different taps, specifically designed for catering, events, schools, offices, small and medium-sized companies, and other situations. In addition, it offers reusable, customisable cups and bottles and lemonade syrups.\n",
      "In 2022, Robinetto installed more than 500 water taps in the group’s central buildings and in Colruyt, Bio-Planet and Okay stores.\n",
      "All customers together tapped over 4 million litres of water from more than 1.500 installations. Together, they avoided the equivalent of over 16 million 25cl-sized packages.\n",
      "Colruyt Group increased Robinetto’s capital at the end of 2022, giving it room to grow further sustainably and to move into the private customers market.\n",
      "Newpharma is Belgium’s largest online pharmacy, with more than 1.700 brands and 45.000 products at reasonable prices. A team of pharmacists provides customers with advice about products ordered and combinations with previous purchases. Newpharma delivers to the home in Belgium (orders placed before noon are delivered within 24 hours) and has a network of 2.000 collection points. Newpharma Group also delivers in thirteen countries, five of which are served with specific ranges: France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany.\n",
      "Solid growth\n",
      "After the busy corona period, Newpharma also achieved solid growth in the past financial year (2022 calendar year), partly as a result of inflation, partly due to the expansion of the customer base. Since corona, seniors are also finding their way more easily to the online pharmacy. Frequency increased and the average shopping basket grew, mainly due to increased sales of non-prescription medicines, and despite the slight shift from premium brands to cheaper alternatives. Newpharma kept its costs under control and its margin stable.\n",
      "On the Belgian market, Newpharma is the second largest online pharmacy in terms of turnover, with the widest penetration in Wallonia. In Flanders, Newpharma is becoming increasingly known thanks to synergies from Colruyt Group..\n",
      "In terms of international growth, Newpharma focuses on Switzerland, where it is number two with Apo24.ch, and on France, where newpharma.fr is already the largest. The activity is growing strongly year after year, partly thanks to access to a wide and relevant range of French brands.\n",
      "Newpharma prides itself on its high customer satisfaction, thanks to, among other things, the wide choice, strong promotions, sufficient stock availability, correct deliveries, sound advice and an accessible customer service\n",
      "Intensive cooperation\n",
      "Newpharma delivers orders in 400 Collishop collection points at Colruyt Lowest Prices and Okay, a delivery method that is very popular. Our store formats also work together with Newpharma Group in other areas.\n",

      "Operations centre partly automated\n",
      "The 21.000 m² operational centre in Liège was commissioned in October 2021 and has been running at full capacity since May 2022. All orders for Belgium and abroad leave from Liège. The larger warehouse allowed Newpharma to increase its stocks and anticipate possible shortages.\n",
      "The site is partly automated with Scallog robots, which look after around 30% of the picking. This automation reduced the margin of error to almost zero and contributed in part to the increase in operational efficiency by a quarter.\n",
      "The current storage space is sufficient to accommodate growth for a few more years. After that, there is potential to expand the site to 50.000 m².\n",

      "Jims runs 34 fitness clubs in Belgium and Luxembourg. As the country’s second largest fitness chain, its mission is to encourage consumers to adopt fitter and healthier lifestyles. Customers follow fitness or strength training in a safe environment and join very diverse group lessons at attractive prices. The fitness chain is strong on individual guidance, with an eye for health in the broad sense.\n",
      "In every club of the network, members can count on quality service from skilled and enthusiastic employees.\n",
      "Record revenues\n",
      "Jims posted strong revenues, due among other things to expansion with new premises, inflow of new members and higher spending per customer, especially for group lessons.\n",
      "In Luxembourg, Jims is the market leader and reference in corporate fitness with four well-functioning clubs. In Belgium, urban clubs are also starting to attract corporate clients, especially through tailor-made packages.\n",
      "The subscription structure has been simplified, with formulas for people who like to train individually, those who want more coaching, or those who want to add specific sports. Quite unique in the sector are the group lessons for limited numbers of 8 to 12 participants from specific target groups, for example power for women or pre- and postnatal guidance.\n",
      "From April 2023, Jims wants to strengthen the workforce per site by one half-time equivalent employee. In this way, a full-time coach can be available in every club, in addition to two part-time employees.\n",
      "We Move With You\n",
      "More than ever, Jims focuses on health in the broad sense of the term, with attention to exercise and also nutrition, sleep, stress prevention, etc. Under the new motto ‘We Move With You’, the fitness chain wants to make health broadly accessible and move with the customers through all phases of life. That translates into focused offers for target groups like beginners, regular sportspersons, pregnant women, the over-55s …\n",
      "The new slogan of the restyled Jims also refers to its commitment to connectedness, between staff and members, between members themselves, with society. The company reaffirmed that commitment through a partnership with the Special Olympics Team Belgium, which prepared for the 2023 Summer Games at Jims.\n",
      "Flywheel for movement and health\n",
      "Jims is active in the field of ‘Health and wellness’ and develops holistic solutions for a healthier lifestyle.\n",
      "Fitness is a rewarding activity for linking exercise and nutrition and also for reaching retail formulas’ target groups via Jims. A small number of co-creations with internal partners: pre- and postnatal training with Dreambaby, training for cyclists with Bike Republic, nutritional supplements from Newpharma, children’s sports camps with Dreamland, etc. The smart, healthy vending machines supplied by our food service company Solucious also inspired the unmanned ‘Spar For You’ concept.\n",
      "Nine innovative pilot projects are currently running within the group, in which, for example, logistics employees receive instruction on the floor in ergonomic lifting and tilting techniques or warming-up exercises to avoid injuries or occupational accidents. Jims is also experimenting with concepts like sports days or relaxation sessions during breaks, in order to further develop and commercialise its services to third parties.\n",
      "Accelerated growth plans\n",
      "Jims invested heavily in expansion and expanded its network from 27 to 34 clubs.\n",
      "In Belgium, the six clubs run by Oxygen were taken over, giving almost complete coverage of East Flanders. The concept of the acquired clubs fits well with that of Jims, with integration costs limited mainly to software implementation and remodelling. By the end of 2023, the clubs will be in the new Jims look. All employees and the majority of customers made the switch.\n",
      "In October 2022, a new club opened in Kuurne, close to the Colruyt Lowest Prices, Bike Republic, Dreamland and Dreambaby outlets. This fitness club is completely fitted in the new house style, which positions Jims higher up in the middle market.\n",
      "In Luxembourg, 1 new club opened and after the end of the financial year, a fitness club was also added in Wilrijk, with a separate ‘Boxing cube’ for premium boxing lessons.\n",
      "Jims is seeking opportunities for further expansion in metropolitan areas. It sees a potential for 50 to 60 clubs in Belgium and Luxembourg, preferably on sites where Colruyt Group is already present. The target for next year is 4 openings and 11 renovations.\n",
      "The newly established Jims Academy ensures greater uniformity in the training of our own and external trainers, who are obtaining more and more European and international quality certificates.\n",
      "The Dreamland family and seasonal store is Belgium’s leading toy seller. It also offers an extensive range of gaming, outdoor toys and garden furniture, in addition to school supplies, books, etc. Dreamland wants to inspire children and their parents to share connecting moments in a fun way. The format consists of physical stores and an online shop. Using the free Click&Collect service, customers can reserve items from the store stock to pick up at the store within three hours. Webshop reservations can also be picked up in a Colruyt or Okay store or delivered to the home.\n",
      "Standing our ground\n",
      "in a challenging market\n",
      "Dreamland has been operating for some time in a challenging market characterised by increasing competition, pressure on volumes, a shift from offline to online consumption and changing customer behaviour. As a result, Dreamland, despite its market leader position, had another difficult financial year. This was made worse by the current macroeconomic context, leading consumers to cancel purchases or wait for the sales. In the first quarter of 2023, revenue was negatively affected by the reduced online offering and the bad spring weather. In those months,\n",
      "Dreamland was able to clear up part of the overstock built up in 2022 through hefty discounts and round prices.\n",
      "In a Belgian toy and gaming market that shrank by about 7% during 2022, Dreamland successfully maintained its leading position. Collectables and merchandising items in particular did well, as did blocks and building kits for young and old. Games and puzzles, on the other hand, were less popular after the earlier boom in the corona period.\n",
      "An in-depth profitability exercise was carried out in the past financial year. Dreamland reduced the number of items, both online and in stores. The children’s rooms and deco categories are now discontinued, and product groups like books, gaming and writing tools whittled down.\n",
      "No new store openings are planned for the present and coming financial years. Dreamland will focus on making the current activities profitable within\n",
      "a reasonable period of time.\n",
      "1 new store in Laneffe\n",
      "Betting on ‘click2brick’\n",
      "Dreamland has been an important omnichannel player for years, combining its extensive store network with an online sales channel. This webshop has proved very difficult to make profitable, especially in times of rising transport costs. Dreamland therefore chose to evolve towards a ‘click2brick’ model, with a more limited online offering and, above all, information and inspiration\n",
      "for purchases in the physical stores, where experience takes precedence for the children and parents target group. The physical shopping experience remains crucial, especially for younger children, offering an advantage over pure online players. Here are a number of measures that were carried out since early 2023:\n",
      "The webshop now focuses only on toys, outdoor toys and garden items.\n",
      "2,99 euros is charged for delivering online orders at Colruyt or Okay, and 5,99 euros for the home delivery of parcels.\n",
      "The well-functioning Click&Collect service in the Dreamland stores remains free of charge. Customers who want to reserve from the store stock can find the exact stock even more easily online.\n",
      "Restructuring at Dreamland and Dreambaby\n",
      "After the financial year closing, Colruyt Group announced on 19 April 2023 its intention to start a restructuring programme for Dreamland and Dreambaby, with the Belgian ‘Renault\n",
      "Act’ collective redundancy legislation applying to 150 and 42 employees of these non-food brands respectively. This\n",
      "includes the intention to close one Dreamland store and five Dreambaby stores.\n",
      "We are convinced that these actions are necessary to ensure the future of Dreamland and Dreambaby. We plan to provide the necessary guidance and support for all colleagues and to do everything we can to work constructively with all parties involved.\n",
      "Acquisition by ToyChamp\n",
      "At the same time, we also announced that we had reached an agreement in principle with the Belgian family business ToyChamp, which will acquire 75% of Dreamland’s shares. ToyChamp is a prominent, profitable player in the toy market with 24 stores in the Netherlands and 9 in Belgium. The objective is to give Dreamland a healthy future in the challenging toy market with ToyChamp as a strong partner. By combining their knowledge and expertise, Dreamland and ToyChamp would together become the number 1 toy retailer in Belgium, with Toychamp also active in the Netherlands.\n",
      "Dreamland is and remains a strong brand that will continue to exist, also as a legal entity and employer. As soon as the transaction (expected by the end of 2023) can be completed,\n",
      "Dreamland will no longer be fully consolidated in the figures of Colruyt Group.\n",
      "Dreambaby is the largest national player in the Belgian baby market, with a wide, high quality product offering for babies and toddlers up to 30 months. The physical stores and the online shop offer a choice of most major brands and the own brand Dreambee. Customers can compile and manage baby gift lists both online and in-store. Online reservations can be collected in Dreambaby, Dreamland and Colruyt stores, or delivered to the customer’s home. Dreambaby stands out for the personal guidance and advice provided by experienced staff.\n",
      "Difficult financial year, focus on profitability\n",
      "Dreambaby has been operating for some time in a challenging market characterised by increasing\n",
      "competition, pressure on volumes, a shift from offline to online consumption and changing customer behaviour. This led to a very difficult financial year in which Dreambaby saw falling sales volumes. The situation was made worse by the current macroeconomic context, with stock shortages in the aftermath of the logistics crisis and customers cancelling or postponing their purchases. The volume decline was most pronounced in the baby gift lists.\n",
      "In a highly competitive landscape, Dreambaby managed to consolidate its market leader position, with the biggest market penetration after second-hand providers.\n",
      "In 2023-24, Dreambaby will focus on making the existing activities profitable and does not plan any (re)openings. In April 2023, after the end of the financial year, the company announced it was permanently closing 5 stores. These\n",
      "are the outlets in Drogenbos, Vilvoorde, Tienen, Beveren and Huy. Internal reorientation will be pursued for the employees involved. See the box on p. 73.\n",
      "The pilot project with an online second-hand platform was discontinued. Dreambaby is thinking hard about how to provide a more customer-friendly and scalable service, to respond to the growing demand for second- hand and to evolve towards a more circular and sustainable baby sector.\n",
      "More synergy within the group\n",
      "Dreambaby invests in customer acquisition and loyalty through successful and new partnerships with various formats.\n",
      "Workshops in collaboration with Colruyt Group Academy. Physically and digitally, with relevant topics about pregnancy and baby. Baby carrying techniques have been a fixed feature for several years.\n",
      "New goodie bag to be picked up in the store, with the cooperation of Newpharma, Foodbag, Jims, Boni and\n",
      "Collect&Go.\n",
      "Anyone handing in a baby gift list receives 150 euro of discounts and free products at almost all our store formats.\n",
      "Vibrant community\n",
      "After a successful test with a closed Facebook group on the subject of sleep, Dreambaby started a new group for future parents. The ‘Pregnant with Dreambaby’ community soon numbered 1.900 members, who exchange experiences, information and tips among themselves.\n",
      "1 new store: La Louvière\n",

      "The Fashion Society groups three multi-brand chains for women’s and men’s fashion, operating mainly in Belgium, but also in Luxembourg and France. These are out-of-town destination stores, with a focus on customer satisfaction and shopping experience.\n",
      "The store concepts target broad but distinct groups, covering a large proportion of the fashion market. Zeb is for confident, fashion- conscious customers seeking inspiration. Family stores PointCarré and The Fashion Store target multi-generational trend followers and focus on personal advice.\n",
      "Highest revenue ever\n",
      "In a challenging fashion market, the fashion group saw its turnover increase strongly, mainly from the opening of new stores and inflow of new customers. Zeb was the strongest performer,\n",
      "The Fashion Store did well and PointCarré was just below expectations. From spring 2022, the textile business felt the inflationary pressure on costs, but a good summer put a shine back on the business. Subsequently, the warm autumn disrupted the start of the winter season. The resulting sales shortfall was partially recovered between mid-November and the end of the financial year. After peaking during the corona period, online sales stabilised at the former level.\n",
      "Customers purchased more price-consciously and looked more actively for promotions, which put some pressure on margins. Thanks in part to strict personnel planning, costs remained under control. After a number of challenging months, the fashion group looks to the future with confidence.\n",
      "The Fashion Society is one of the few fashion retailers to continue to invest in expansion, with seven new stores in 2022 and five planned openings for 2023. The group offers customers continuously changing collections, with the right articles at the right time. They can also count on numerous deals and promotions, plenty of shopping experience and communication tailored to their needs.\n",
      "As a result, the group’s market share continues to grow, both in Flanders and in Wallonia.\n",
      "New stores in Auvelais, Dour, Braine-le-Comte, Mechelen en Lier, with 1.500 m² the largest in the country.\n",
      "Potential for more than 100 stores in Belgium, of which 70 in Flanders.\n",
      "Experience and co-creation\n",
      "Zeb provided lots of shopping experience during the past financial year, including a fashion show and campaigns with well-known ambassadors like James Cooke.\n",
      "Zeb also remains strong in exclusive co-creations, including new collections from Nora Gharib and Tourist LeMC.\n",
      "In recent years, the chain has invested heavily in making its stores accessible to persons with disabilities. The Zeb for Everyone action plan has already won several awards. For example, Queen Mathilde visited Zeb Merchtem, as part of the ‘De Warmste Entrée’ initiative of trade federation Comeos.\n",
      "Customers are increasingly making use of private shopping outside opening hours.\n",
      "New stores in Sint- Katelijne-Waver, Zoersel, Kalmthout and Hasselt\n",
      "Potential of 30 stores, mainly in Flanders\n",
      "The Fashion Store launched its new webshop, added new collections and continued to roll out its Personal styling service.\n",
      "31 stores, of which 12 in franchise (mainly in Wallonia and 2 in France)\n",
      "New store in Soignies\n",
      "The franchise formula is proving successful in France, where independence and\n",
      "an individual approach are appreciated. The chain wants to open three integrated flagship stores there in 2023, as an accelerator for later expansion through franchising.\n",
      "In Belgium, PointCarré took over three Belgian stores from franchisees.\n",
      "Bike Republic is a leading seller of primarily e-bikes, cycling clothing and accessories to individuals and companies. The extensive bike range consists of thirty top brands, including the Hiron own brand. As a ‘compagnon de route’ for every moment, Bike Republic wants to provide pure cycling pleasure to as many people as possible, from commuters and recreational cyclists to sports enthusiasts.\n",
      "The bicycle specialist excels in accessibility, through its attractive shops, well-arranged website and high accessibility by phone and online. Bike Republic also sets itself apart through providing top notch service and making life easier for customers with sound advice, excellent after-sales service, maintenance and repair in its own workshops, insurance, etc. B2B customers can count on a total solution, with various buy or leasing formulas, customised cycle plans and a wide range of services.\n",
      "Significant growth strengthens market position\n",
      "Expansion moves up a gear\n",
      "Bike Republic continues to invest heavily in expansion, adding six branches last financial year, including a first in the Brussels Region. With rural Flanders now fairly well covered, the focus will shift in the coming years to Flemish cities like Bruges and Antwerp, and then to Brussels and Wallonia. Our bike specialist sees potential for around sixty shops in Belgium and wants to become the reference on the (e-)bike market.\n",
      "Multiple criteria are taken into consideration in acquisitions, including (potential) revenue, brand portfolio, identity, culture and craftsmanship, services and unique assets.\n",
      "The Evere store was taken over from family business IMP Bike, a well-known name in Brussels. As the first truly bilingual store, Evere is an important springboard towards the French-speaking market.\n",
      "The stores in Aalst and Ninove were acquired from CycloM, those in Retie and Turnhout from Cycling Van der Veken, both established names in their regions.\n",
      "In a growing bike market, Bike Republic almost doubled its revenue, partly by expansion and partly by increased sales in the existing points of sale. The additional sales came mainly from B2B customers, while private spending remained stable. B2B sales already represent a third of total sales.\n",
      "Bike Republic continues to steadily increase its market share and is extending its lead as the country’s largest multi-brand chain. This upscaling is a strategic advantage for being able at all times to offer customers the right bike, given the continuing long delivery times and shortages at suppliers.\n",
      "The range was further enriched with a number of quality brands. Bike Republic now has an attractive range of e-bikes in the middle to premium segment, supplemented with a range of classic entry to middle segment (sports) bikes. The company is also increasingly focused on cargo bikes for couriers, craftspeople or liberal professions who want to move around the city sustainably and smoothly.\n",
      "New store in Sint-Denijs-Westrem\n",
      "Acquisitions in Evere, Ninove and Aalst, Retie and Turnhout\n",
      "The new Bike Republic in Sint-Denijs-Westrem is one of the largest outlets, including a 1.000 m² showroom with no fewer than 300 bikes and an indoor test course.\n",
      "With three stores in the greater Ghent area, Bike Republic is easily accessible for customers from both the city and\n",
      "the suburbs. They can view the entire collection and order a bike in Sint-Denijs-Westrem and then have it delivered and maintained in a city shop. Accessibility trumps!\n",
      "A first:\n",
      "the CityQ cargo bike\n",
      "Bike Republic is the exclusive distributor in our country of the Norwegian-German CityQ electric cargo bikes. These combine the comfort of a car with the advantages of an e-bike, making them interesting for companies, self-employed people, and families alike. The modular bike is available with, for example, a closed cargo box or a bench seat at the back,\n",
      "if desired with stickers and a custom finish.\n",
      "Betting on the business market\n",
      "Bike Republic still sees lots of market potential for company bicycles, offering business customers attractive purchase and lease formulas, customised bicycle plans and a wide range of services like tax advice, maintenance and repair, and assistance. In order\n",
      "to unburden B2B customers even more, a new platform came on line in March 2023 for complete fleet management, from purchase through depreciation to residual value. Employees can also use the platform to book appointments for maintenance and repairs\n",
      "Intragroup synergies\n",
      "Bike Republic regularly organises promotions with other store formats.\n",

      "Retail Partners Colruyt Group is the licensee of the Spar format in Belgium and works closely with the independent Spar storekeepers. Besides supply and assortment management, the organisation also takes care of commercial policy, from promotion and marketing to sales support. RPCG has a unique consultation model, in partnership with the elected delegation of retailers. Together, they shape the look of the stores, product range, commercial focus and the future of Spar Colruyt Group.\n",
      "RPCG also supplies fresh products and groceries to independent Alvo storekeepers and unaffiliated clients\n",
      "Solid financial year\n",
      "Given the difficult socio-economic context, Retail Partners Colruyt Group can look back on a solid financial year.\n",
      "Revenue rose, mainly as a result of rising inflation, while sales volumes clearly declined. The customers of the affiliated stores visited more frequently, taking away smaller average shopping baskets. Sales fell most in categories like alcohol and home maintenance, while bread and deli dishes saw volumes increase. Nevertheless, RPCG maintained its customer base and market share, which is a good performance in a challenging retail market.\n",
      "Pressure on the margin from inflation and wage indexation was largely eliminated by tight cost control, thanks among other things to energy-saving measures and optimised staffing with fewer temporary and interim employees. With its high-performance IT platform, RPCG was able to switch gear quickly enough and take measures right among the logistics chain to flexibly absorb the decrease in volume.\n",
      "Independent Spar entrepreneurs saw their profitability threatened by high energy expenditure and by the wage indexation in January 2023. RPCG provided support where necessary by, for example, accelerating the (energy) renovation of the stores and with technical analyses and energy audits for entrepreneurs who wanted.\n",
      "RPCG maintained its delivery reliability at an exceptionally high level throughout the financial year. The excellent level of service to independent retailers is generally recognised in the sector.\n",
      "In the past financial year, the number of Spar retailers remained more or less stable, as did the number of Alvo stores. RPCG had slightly fewer unaffiliated clients, due to cessations of activity or upscaling. RPCG is keen to further expand its network of affiliated and independent clients.\n",
      "Context for successful entrepreneurship\n",
      "Even in a difficult retail market, RPCG is looking for new independent entrepreneurs for the Spar format, which remains one of the most profitable in the franchise market. Candidate entrepreneurs can count on broad support in starting their businesses.\n",
      "RPCG can offer entrepreneurs decent margins by rigorously continuing to focus on efficiency throughout the supply chain, from order processing to invoicing. At the same time, the organisation monitors the profitability of the affiliated stores, facilitating timely preventive intervention if necessary.\n",
      "The franchise model offers a lot of scope for personal entrepreneurship and a wide range of support services and advice, for example for improving cost structures.\n",
      "Starting from a stable IT environment with a solid, resilient supply chain and high delivery reliability, RPCG above all creates a context that makes successful entrepreneurship possible.\n",
      "Spar Colruyt Group is the friendly neighbourhood supermarket for daily grocery shopping, offering a good range of fresh products, personal service and competitive prices. With their specific skills and product ranges, the independent retailers set their own accents in their stores. Spar provides inspiration through its free KOOK magazine and is well-known for its weekly 50% off Top Deals.\n",
      "Most stores are also open on Sunday (morning).\n",
      "Remodelling pays off\n",
      "Though remodelling requires considerable investment, retailers can count on sales and marketing support and a partial loan. Once at cruising speed, a new Spar Colruyt Group store performs noticeably better than the market.\n",
      "Remodelling also pays ample attention to energy efficiency. Through RPCG, entrepreneurs can obtain technical advice and energy audits and enjoy favourable conditions from contractors, installers and suppliers.\n",
      "During the past financial year 9 stores were fully remodelled and expanded, resulting in 64 stores in the Spar Colruyt Group outfit by the end of the financial year.\n",
      "5 new stores and 12 remodellings in 2023/24\n",
      "Great Deal\n",
      "Sensing that customers are also attaching greater importance to strong promotions, Spar therefore relooked its fortnightly folder. The ‘Lekker veel voordeel’ (Great Deal) concept has been refreshed: the 1+1 offers are now at the front of the folder and the strongest promotions stand out more.\n",
      "In the monthly Kook magazine, inspiration always comes first. After a screening of recipients, circulation was reduced by a quarter.\n",
      "Differentiating with fresh goods\n",
      "Many Spar stores are known for their generous departments presenting all kinds of fruit and vegetables, deli dishes, meat, cheese and bread. These are pre-eminently spearhead categories with which entrepreneurs distinguish themselves in their environments and also achieve good margins. Bakeries equipped with their own dough proofers deliver superior quality bread. For launching and operating their bakeries, the entrepreneurs can count on advice from experts, often former bakers themselves.\n",
      "More and more entrepreneurs are using the central e-commerce platform, on which customers place orders for the year-end or BBQ season.\n",
      "New: Spar For You\n",
      "unmanned sales format\n",
      "Spar For You is a new, unmanned catering concept for the B2B market responding to contemporary needs like flexible working and on-the-go consumption. The concept allows companies, healthcare institutions, organisations, hotels or schools to achieve significant efficiency gains.\n",
      "Spar For You is available in various configurations, from one or more smart refrigerators, to a food corner with fresh coffee, to a minimarket. Employees, visitors and passers-by enjoy ease of use, contact-free payment and 24/7 availability.\n",
      "The service provides stocking, security and technology, which greatly relieves B2B clients. Clients also gain insight into the sales results and products offered, so as to make any necessary adjustments.\n",
      "Spar For You is a successful collaboration between Spar, our innovation hub Smart Technics, and our food service specialist Solucious, which takes care of the supply side.\n",
      "In 2022, test projects were undertaken, among others, for ISS and SN Brussels Airlines. In early 2023, a major project was introduced at UCB.\n",
      "Codifrance supplies more than 300 mini-markets affiliated to the Coccinelle, Coccimarket and Panier Sympa brands with dry goods, fresh produce and frozen food. The affiliated retailers also receive assistance with marketing, communication, defining product ranges, refurbishment and design of their points of sale.\n",
      "In addition, Codifrance supplies around 1.200 independent shops and wholesalers in more than 70 departments.\n",
      "The mini-markets, found both in the city and the country, are primarily aimed at customers who come in daily. Codifrance offers the independent operators a wide assortment of products from national brands, private labels (Belle France) and discount brands. The operators enjoy a considerable measure of freedom in managing their stores.\n",
      "Slight revenue growth\n",
      "Codifrance once again ended the financial year on a positive note, with good revenue growth. Ever since the often strongly restricted freedom of movement during the corona period, French consumers have remained remarkably loyal to the shops in their immediate vicinity. Even in a context of high inflation, local distribution channels have remained popular, with their diverse range of products and services as well as social contact.\n",
      "The operating result improved, thanks in part to continued strict debtor monitoring. Codifrance was able to mitigate the impact of the strong inflation by continuing to control transport costs.\n",
      "The new, high-performance ERP system will be fully delivered in October 2023. This will allow the organisation to improve its operational excellence, productivity and profitability even further.\n",
      "Our French wholesale branch is a major player in the mini-market sector, which is an integral part of French consumers’ daily lives. Codifrance wants to further grow its retail network with quality shops run by passionate, enterprising operators.\n",
      "Food service company Solucious supplies food products to professional customers throughout Belgium, primarily in social catering (schools, hospitals, care homes, etc.), the hospitality industry, and corporate catering. The range includes dry, fresh and frozen products, both in small and large packages, from national brands, the group’s own Culino and Econom food service brands for professional chefs and the group’s own retail brands Boni Selection and Everyday.\n",
      "Solucious stands out for its ease-of-use, fair and consistent pricing with bulk discounts and constant reliability, about which it communicates transparently. The Culinoa department advises and supports care institutions in the operation of their industrial kitchens.\n",
      "Strong performance\n",
      "For the second consecutive year, Solucious achieved exceptional revenue growth, driven in part by inflation but to a greater extent by strong volume increases.\n",
      "In a stagnating food service market, the company was able to convince new customers, especially in the hospitality sector, including several larger catering chains. Social catering, the proportionally largest segment, grew slightly, thanks to good results from several large customers who had already chosen Solucious in the previous financial year. Company catering, on the other hand, still suffered somewhat from the widespread home-working. Culinoa, for its part, was able to add a small number of new care centres to its customer portfolio.\n",
      "Solucious kept its costs under control and continued to invest in future growth. The supply chain was strengthened with additional storage space and the recruitment of new employees. The company also continued to focus on digitising its internal business processes and on further expanding the e-commerce platform.\n",
      "On average, about 96% of the ordered items are available in stock. This enables Solucious to maintain a high level of delivery reliability, a key asset in the food service business.\n",
      "Refrigerated storage space doubled\n",
      "Solucious is serving more and more large customers with fresh products and is also keen to offer a wider choice of fresh foods. For this, the refrigerated warehouse in Bornem was expanded from 3.600 to 7.900 m², using space freed up with the departure of the Colex export service. The existing spaces were divided up and furnished differently, resulting in both more efficient, safer and more pleasant working conditions and increased delivery reliability.\n",
      "Cooling rooms at 12 °C for fruit and vegetables, 4 °C for dairy and meat.\n",
      "Picking of goods and transport to 5 regional hubs. Bornem itself also functions as a hub.\n",
      "Daily average of 28.000 picks or 900 orders.\n",
      "Sustainability: 640 solar panels and cooling with heat recovery that covers 80% of the heating needs in the offices.\n",
      "Even more customer convenience through internal synergy\n",

      "DATS 24 offers all common and alternative energy sources in Belgium: petrol, diesel, AdBlue and also natural gas (CNG), electricity and hydrogen. Colruyt Group’s fuel specialist and energy supplier\n",
      "is working towards greener mobility. It continues to invest in the expansion of its network, with a focus on electric charging\n",
      "infrastructure and public hydrogen stations. DATS 24 informs and inspires individuals and companies about how to achieve more sustainable mobility via workshops, talks and webinars. It holds ISO 14001 certification for the ecological management of its stations.\n",
      "DATS 24 played a pioneering role over 50 years ago as a Discount Automatic Tanking Service with the first unmanned 24/24 filling stations.\n",
      "Exceptional volatility\n",
      "DATS 24 experienced an exceptional financial year in all respects, in a highly volatile fuel market. Revenue rose in parallel with inflation throughout the financial year. The increase came from sales of traditional fuels, while the CNG volumes fell by more than a quarter, as customers switched to conventional fuels given the continued exceptionally high natural gas prices. Total sales volume decreased slightly, also in line with the contraction in the market.\n",
      "The customer count remained more or less stable, while the volume per refuelling dropped slightly. The latter was probably due to sharper customer price awareness and stricter budgeting, to the continuation of teleworking and the increasing proportion of hybrid cars that tank up in smaller volumes.\n",
      "Margins remained at the same level, although the market system caused DATS 24 to sell almost at a loss for a while, given the delay in official maximum prices catching up with ever-increasing purchase prices. Subsequently, all fuel brands started to apply the maximum prices, which largely halted the competitive promotions and boosted margins.\n",
      "DATS 24 accelerated the introduction of pumps with AdBlue, an additive that significantly reduces NOx emissions from diesel engines. At the end of the financial year, the product was available at 85 service stations while revenues more than doubled.\n",
      "4 new filling stations\n",
      "2 extra CNG refuelling points\n",
      "270 additional charging points\n",
      "Focus on electric mobility\n",
      "Charging stations at 230 locations\n",
      "DATS 24 invested further in expanding its charging network, both at Colruyt Group stores and offices and at external customers. Green electricity was available at the end of the financial year to 735 charging points at 230 locations, including 13 points where customers can charge at a capacity of up to 60 kW. More than a third of the Colruyt, Okay, Bio-Planet, Dreamland and Dreambaby stores already have one or more charging stations, so that customers can easily combine shopping and charging.\n",
      "Charging plazas are gradually being built at a number of selected store car parks, where up to ten users can charge at any one time. There, DATS 24 will also be responding to the growing demand for rapid charging, with three 150 KW rapid chargers in combination with two regular 22 KW chargers.\n",
      "In the past financial year, consumption in kWh at DATS 24 charging stations more than doubled, partly due to the expansion of the network, partly due to the growing share of electrically powered cars.\n",
      "The DATS 24 charge card gives subscribers access to more than\n",
      "23.000 Belgian and 222.000 international charging stations.\n",
      "First charging stations for external customers\n",
      "On the B2B market, DATS 24 focuses primarily on companies linked to Colruyt Group. At the end of the financial year, for example, (rapid) charging stations had already been installed at seven independent Spar stores. The retailers purchase the charging stations and receive\n",
      "a portion of the proceeds. The charging stations have a wide prospective customer base, accepting numerous charging cards and usually also accessible outside the stores’ opening hours.\n",
      "The cooperation is a win-win. The external customer can count on the craftsmanship and reliability of DATS 24, from the choice of charger type to installation to inspection and aftercare. On the other hand, our energy\n",
      "specialist can make sustainable mobility more accessible, at home, on the road and at work.\n",
      "Bundled expertise\n",
      "In just a few years, DATS 24 has built up a great fund of expertise in the installation and operation of charging infrastructure at Colruyt Group stores, companies and employees at home. To further accelerate the expansion, our energy specialist has teamed up with Antwerp charging station company Pluginvest, which will take care of installing and maintaining the network. With an investment of EUR 4 million, Colruyt Group acquired a 25% participation in Pluginvest in mid-May 2022.\n",
      "Advertising at petrol stations\n",
      "The filling stations are gradually being used more for onsite media selling, via screens on the pumps and printed posters in all 145 stations. In addition, about thirty stations are equipped with large digital screens, operated in collaboration with Clear Channel Belgium. DATS 24 screens its own quality or sustainability messages, but also campaigns from internal partners like Newpharma, as well as messages from external advertisers.\n",
      "New payment terminals\n",
      "By the end of the financial year, all petrol stations were equipped with new payment terminals that excel in ease of use: well-lit, clearly legible, suitable for all cards and contactless payment. The 400 metre paper roll does not need to be replaced as quickly and terminal operation can be perfectly remote-monitored.\n",

      "The company will also continue to contribute to the realisation of\n",
      "Colruyt Group’s strategic objectives.\n",
      "Energy holding company Virya Energy is active in the development, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of renewable energy production facilities, with a particular focus on offshore and onshore wind energy.\n",
      "Virya Energy was established at the end of 2019 by Colruyt Group and its majority shareholder Korys. The holding company invests in companies focusing on the production of green electricity from wind and hydroelectric sources and on the development of plants for the production and storage of green hydrogen. The umbrella holding company facilitates the sharing of knowledge and technology between the companies and invests heavily in support services, research & development.\n",
      "In 2022, Virya Energy produced more than\n",
      "1.548 GWh of green energy, equivalent to the annual consumption of over 440.000 families.\n",
      "Belgian company Parkwind is active in the production of offshore wind energy, in various countries. It develops activities throughout the entire value chain and collaborates with universities and government institutions in various research programmes.\n",
      "Offshore wind farms in Belgium\n",
      "Parkwind participates in four operational wind farms located in the North Sea off the Belgian coast. In 2022, these wind farms together produced 2.127 GWh of green electricity, or the equivalent of the annual consumption of 607.000 households, making Parkwind one of the largest electricity producers in Belgium. The company also plans to participate in tenders for the construction of wind farms in the Princess Elisabeth zone off the Belgian coast in 2024.\n",
      "Weak winds, both offshore and onshore, made 2022 a poor wind year, one of the worst ever in Northern Europea.\n",
      "This weak wind harvest was offset to a small extent by historically higher energy prices, as a result of the international energy crisis. Price increases could, however, be realised only on a limited part of the energy production, as sales prices are usually fixed in long-term contracts.\n",
      "General inflation pushed up operating costs in the course of 2022.\n",
      "With an average of over 95%, installation availability once again remained at a high level. Operational continuity was also ensured throughout the year.\n",
      "Offshore wind farms abroad\n",
      "Parkwind continues to develop international wind projects, with a focus on Europe, but also in Australia and New Zealand.\n",
      "Arcadis Ost I. As planned, the wind farm in the German part of the Baltic Sea started producing power in the spring of 2023 with a limited number of turbines. The project went well, but was delayed by postponed deliveries of parts. With, among other things, the conclusion of new agreements with suppliers and banks, the park will be fully operational as planned by the end of 2023.\n",
      "27 turbines with a combined capacity of 256 MW will be able to provide up to 290.000 German families with green electricity.\n",
      "Oriel. Parkwind and Irish electricity company ESB obtained the necessary permits to participate in May 2023 in the call for tenders for the future wind farm in the Irish Sea. If they win the contract, the first steps could follow from autumn 2023 to develop a wind farm with 375 MW installed capacity.\n",
      "Both partners are working together on a future Irish wind farm Clogherhead.\n",
      "Norway. Together with two local partners, Parkwind is preparing to participate in tenders for two offshore wind farms in Norwegian waters in 2023.\n",
      "Greece. Parkwind has contracted with local conglomerate Intrakat to compete in a tender for a 300 MW onshore wind farm.\n",
      "Onshore renewable energy\n",
      "In line with its ambition to pursue an even more sustainable impact, Virya is consolidating and further expanding its internal know-how and competences. For this reason, the Eurowatt and Eoly Energy teams are cooperating more and more closely in onshore wind and solar energy.\n",
      "Eoly Energy operates in the Belgian energy market, managing 21 onshore wind turbines, 3 of which are owned by Eoly Cooperative. The company is also working on developing a further 19 new onshore turbines in Belgium. Several research programmes are running for the production and application of green hydrogen.\n",
      "In 2022, Eoly Energy produced 71 GWh of green electricity, the equivalent of the annual consumption of 20.000\n",
      "households. The significantly lower than expected results were due to frequent low wind speeds. Availability was 94,47%, lower than usual, but caused by technical\n",
      "issues that were subsequently resolved by the suppliers. In January 2023, availability climbed back to 96,57%.\n",
      "Affligem. Environmental permit application for 2 wind turbines along the E40 highway, together with power producer and supplier ENGIE. Local residents can co-invest through their CoGreen cooperative.\n",
      "Application submitted for an extension of the existing wind farm on the Dassenveld site in Halle.\n",
      "Eurowatt produces onshore wind energy and small- scale hydropower. The company has 34 operational wind farms in France, Portugal and Poland and 3 hydroelectric power stations in Spain and Portugal, with a total installed capacity of approximately 400 MW. In 2022, all sites together produced 840 GWh of electricity, the equivalent of the annual consumption of 240.000 households.\n",
      "Eurowatt is focused on expansion with the development and construction of new wind farms and solar parks in France and Poland, where plenty of potential remains for developing renewable energy.\n",
      "In Greece, the Virya group obtained the permit to start developing an approx. 250 MW wind farm.\n",
      "Eurowatt is studying various formulas to allow citizens to participate in wind and solar projects in the geographical zones where it operates.\n",
      "Sanchore\n",
      "The Indian Sanchore wind farm has 20 turbines with a total capacity of 40 MW and has been operational since 2018. In 2022, the wind farm produced 94,5 GWh of green electricity, in line with previous years. Following a debt refinancing, Sanchore again has sufficient own resources.\n",
      "Virya Services\n",
      "The Virya Services branch combines a wide range of support services to energy-producing companies, with which Virya Energy covers a larger part of the offshore value chain. In 2021, participations were taken in three Belgian companies, while the first full working year 2022 focused\n",
      "on supporting the entities in Virya Energy. In 2023, Virya Services wants to focus more on international expansion and on also offering maintenance, repair and safety services to wind farms beyond the development phase.\n",

The company therefore continues to invest in a secure and agile IT environment that allows for the development of new data-driven services.\n",
      "Less paper, more value\n",
      "In a highly competitive market, Symeta Hybrid produced attractive volumes of printed matter for partners in Colruyt Group and for external clients. Owing in part to the strong price increases for paper and energy, demand for printed matter fell noticeably.\n",
      "Symeta Hybrid continues to create lots of value thanks to its lead in personalised printing. For example, it leads the\n",
      "way in producing paper wrappers for leaflets and magazines, segmented and personalised down to individual level. The wrappers are just one of the ways in which paper can be used as a differentiator.\n",
      "Symeta Hybrid is perfectly prepared for the accelerating shift from classic printing to more targeted communication, with an eye to sustainability, cost-efficiency and relevance.\n",
      "With long-term contracts in government services and telecom for producing and dispatching transactional documents, Symeta Hybrid proves the perfect partner for organisations keen to outsource their print and mailing activities. To accommodate future growth in this area, 1,5 million euros was invested in additional mailing machines.\n",
      "Booming paper and energy prices put pressure on margins. Contractual conditions meant that inflation could not be passed on to clients in full or else only with a delay, apart from a few interim adjustments. Clients also more often considered using cheaper paper types.\n",

      "activities\n",
      "From IT over technology to communication: Colruyt Group has significant in-house expertise that we put at the service of internal partners, employees, and customers. In this chapter, you can find a selection of our group support activities and achievements of the past financial year.\n",

      "tonnes of spreads produced\n",
      "tonnes of cheese packed\n",
      "tonnes of coffee roasted\n",
      "million loaves baked\n",
      "Less meat, more bread\n",
      "In a shrinking retail market, Fine Food too saw its production volumes fall and shift in the past financial year. This trend was strongest in beef, slightly milder in pork and least in poultry, charcuterie and salad spreads. The production of vegetarian salad spreads doubled. Inflation caused consumers to look for cheaper alternatives, reflected,\n",
      "for example, in a shift from fresh meat to prepared products, or from Boni to Everyday. With the decrease in volume, a larger share of meat could be processed internally instead of being outsourced.\n",
      "The production volumes of cheese, coffee and wine remained more or less stable, while those of the bakeries increased slightly, partly thanks to the very competitive prices and the success of the bake-off bread for Okay, of budget products in general and of sandwiches for the international market.\n",
      "Profitability came under pressure from purchase price inflation and wage indexation in January 2023, while Fine Food passed on its higher costs only partially and with a delay.\n",
      "Fine Food expects categories like meat to remain expensive in the coming year, due to the persistently high prices for feed, packaging materials and additives such as butter, milk and eggs.\n",
      "The production departments will invest even more in developing specific ranges for our store formats, with greater attention to sustainability aspects such as the protein shift and recyclable packaging. For example, the site already produces an attractive assortment of hummus and other vegetarian products.\n",
      "Continuing\n",
      "vertical integration\n",
      "Colruyt Group continues to invest in its own production and vertical integration.\n",
      "In order to increase our efficiency and competitiveness, we will phase out poultry production at the Wommelgem site and fully centralise it at the Fine Food Meat\n",
      "site in Halle no later than December 2023. This centralisation permits synergies along with more efficient transfers between our production and distribution centres. The new location is also better suited to the slightly declining market volumes. The number of employment places will be maintained and the employees involved will receive personal guidance.\n",
      "Permit applications have been filed for building a new cheese slicing and packaging hall, also on the Fine Food site in Halle, which should become operational in the course\n",
      "of 2025.\n",
      "Investing in domestic production\n",
      "Colruyt Group has been consciously investing in Belgian agriculture for years, to anchor production in its home country, to ensure\n",
      "a future for local skills and to set up sustainable collaboration forms. With guaranteed purchase\n",
      "systems among other things, we offer farmers income security and the prospect of sustainable growth. This way, as a Belgian retailer, we can\n",
      "continue to offer consumers a maximum of Belgian products, in sufficient volume, with guaranteed quality and at a correct price.\n",
      "In recent years, we have structured various direct collaboration models with Belgian farmers, in which they take part as independent entrepreneurs, individually or in groups. These models combine our expertise with that of farmers and other links in the agri-food chain. Together, we form an important lever for even closer cooperation.\n",
      "We currently work directly with no less than 600 Belgian agricultural businesses, including potato and fruit growers, dairy and cattle farmers, and chicken breeders. Together with producers and other partners, we have also set up a few completely new chains, for example for organic baking wheat, milk and organic pork.\n",
      "We also use our financial heft to invest in our own production facilities, such as the organic farm Het Zilverleen and our sea farm for cultivating mussels. We have also purchased 500 hectares of agricultural land, which we make available to independent farmers, while the products harvested on it are sold in our stores.\n",
      "This collaboration allows farmers to use their machines in a more cost-effective manner and work more land without having to invest in the purchase themselves. We work structurally with the partner-producers, consulting together on items like crop planning. Together, we are also stronger to move forward in product innovation and sustainability, including biodiversity and soil health. And because as a retailer we are involved at the beginning of the chain, we can respond more quickly to evolving customer demands. It is important here that we opt for long-term sustainable partnerships: in this way, we commit that the high-quality agricultural land we have purchased will effectively remain just that.\n",
      "Festive themes in demand\n",
      "After corona, customers found their way back to the learning centres fairly quickly and were already well acquainted with the now structurally embedded online offering. The Academy invested in new themes and formats, individually or in groups, in physical or digital format.\n",
      "The culinary themes remained very popular, with physical workshops in the Academy kitchens, digital lectures and demo cooking to follow at home. In the run-up to the festive seasons, the Academy always scores well with inspiration and tips to relax and enjoy partying together. For example, at the end of the year, the Okay session on party snacks counted almost 1.100 participants.\n",
      "In 2022, Colruyt Group Academy strengthened its presence in the business market, with a wide range of workshops, lectures and team building activities in addition to room rental.\n",
      "Day camps for children\n",
      "For the second summer holiday in a row, the Academy organised day camps for children aged 6 to 12 years in Melle,\n",
      "Grimbergen and Namur. The day care offered is meaningful and affordable with sporting, relaxing, creative or scientific activities,\n",
      "in collaboration with Dreamland. Parents can telework for free in the Academy and count on child-sitting before and after the\n",
      "activity. With advertising of the summer 2023 activities already starting in February, a large number of reservations had already come in by the end of June.\n",
      "Craftsmanship in learning\n",
      "L&D took further steps in its transition from organiser to facilitator of all possible forms of learning within the group, and supporter of everyone involved in learning. In this way, a network has been set up in which some two hundred learning professionals exchange knowledge and experience. Regardless of the content, they reinforce each other in teaching crafts and methods.\n",
      "The former training teams have been converted into ‘professional teams’, which are closer to the business and are familiar with its needs. Greater focus has been placed on the smooth, efficient integration of new employees, providing them with the right resources to grow both professionally and personally.\n",
      "Mix of physical and digital learning\n",
      "Since corona, one-fifth of the training offering takes the form of digital training courses, to be followed in the classroom or individually. Language lessons, for example, are largely digital for reasons of efficiency. Store employees are also increasingly receiving tools, manuals\n",
      "and how-to videos on their smartphones to view when it suits them best. Given the need for personal connection and involvement, other courses take place only physically.\n",
      "Responding to the evolving employee needs, the department continues to enrich its offering with new or updated training courses in fields like personal growth, corporate culture, leadership and first aid.\n",
      "With more than 2.000 registrations, the course on value perception was the most attended. Many employees also joined workshops on undesirable transgressive behaviour or programmes on cooperation and team development.\n",
      "Adjusted personnel policy\n",
      "An adjusted recruitment and selection policy contributed to a better cost structure for the group in the past financial year.\n",
      "Departing staff were not automatically replaced with new hires, except for essential profiles and shortage professions like sales staff, butchers, computer scientists and engineers.\n",
      "Greater attention was paid to the attendance policy and to activating employees with long-term sicknesses. Managers received new team monitoring dashboards.\n",
      "The expertise centres worked hard on the more targeted deployment and development of existing employee skills.\n",
      "The support services optimised their operation by more sharply defining their services and focusing on efficiency and essentials.\n",
      "Priority to internal mobility\n",
      "Since the end of 2022, we have made maximum use of internal mobility to fill vacancies. This enables us to switch gears quickly and consolidate the expertise within the group. At the same time, as a large and diverse company, we offer almost all\n",
      "profiles the opportunity to take new directions within the group.\n",
      "As a standard rule, new vacancies are open for two months exclusively for internal employees. Only if there is still no suitable candidate do we go searching outside.\n",
      "The internal recruitment process has been shortened to a maximum of one month.\n",
      "Employees who need or want to change direction can count on extra guidance, in addition to tools like the internal job site, the job mail with new, suitable vacancies and toolboxes for those wanting to grow in their current roles, evolve into different ones or are still looking.\n",
      "Pay statements digital from now on\n",
      "At the beginning of 2023, 12.500 employees in Belgium already received their pay statements digitally via the external platform Doccle. In the meantime, we have decided to make all Belgian pay statements available digitally from June 2023 and to no longer send printed versions by default.\n",
      "We are keen to further digitise our administrative documents and evolve with the world around us. Doccle is the largest and most versatile digital platform in Belgium for managing personal administration.\n",
      "Cost consciousness and sustainability. By no longer printing pay statements and sending them by post, we can save up to 300.000 euros and 5 tonnes of paper annually.\n",
      "Ease of use. All digital wage statements since 2015 are stored in one central location, and can be consulted anytime, anywhere. Employees who lack digital tools can still request to receive their pay statements on paper.\n",
      "Optimalisation and automation\n",
      "Support with the embedding of a new planning tool at Colruyt, which saves each store an average of one full-time equivalent.\n",
      "Emerging automation of repetitive, volume- driven and time-consuming administrative computer work. This process automation has already been applied in finance, the contact centres and the supply chain, and offers potential for the future.\n",
      "Realising optimisations in the return process for defective electronic price labels, in loading and unloading activities and in the cleaning of trailers, as well as in work processes of invoice control, student recruitment, etc.\n",
      "Investing in cost efficiency\n",
      "Customer Services continued to invest in systems and processes, in employee training and in organisational restructuring. Together, this resulted in good efficiency gains and a 10% decrease in employee count.\n",
      "Flexible organisation. The various teams for food, non-food, energy, Xtra and social media were merged into a large, versatile team, which serves customers of several store formats. This requires extra training, but also permits a more balanced division of labour and lower occupation at off-peak times. All teams are now physically housed on a single site, which has greatly reduced the premises cost.\n",
      "Optimised accessibility. The department has reduced its opening windows, especially during off-peak hours, but can still be reached by telephone: daily from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., on Sundays from 10 a.m.\n",
      "Fruitful interaction. Customer Services systematically informs our store formats of their customers’ questions. In this way, they can make their processes more customer-oriented, and the contact centre also ultimately receives fewer customer enquiries. Customers are increasingly finding their way to the online FAQs.\n",
      "New tools. The rollout of new, user-friendly tools and the related integration of social media into the contact platform were completed. Integration of AI solutions such as chatbots will follow later.\n",
      "Best in class\n",
      "Customer Services strives to be best in class in the contact centre industry.\n",
      "Employees are given ample training and career opportunities, and many are truly bilingual.\n",
      "Employees can specify many preferences for their work schedules, work a maximum of one Sunday every two months and can work from home or regionally up to three days a week.\n",
      "Even in the middle of the energy crisis, the contact centre remained easily accessible for questions about energy supplier DATS 24.\n",
      "Cost reductions\n",
      "The IT department contributed to improving the cost structure at group level.\n",
      "Creative interventions have enabled a number of investments planned for the past and next financial year to be postponed to a later date. In addition, the scope of a number of projects was reduced to the essentials, without any direct impact on day-to-day operations.\n",
      "The software licences and the number of accesses have been reviewed to match real needs.\n",
      "The mainframes were sold in order to bring back the latest new mainframe version via lease.\n",

In the meantime, these have developed working methods and methodologies, and documented and defined their service offerings, in order to continue working on improving the service over the next two years.\n",

Thus, they are perfectly connected to each other and to the central services, and equipped to help customers.

      "In the past financial year, special attention was paid to the energy efficiency of buildings, machines and processes. Campaigns were launched encouraging employees to save energy in simple ways in their everyday work as well.\n",
      "With success: some fifty initiatives between October and December 2022 significantly cut energy consumption. The stores consumed 30% less gas, while the distribution centres and offices more than halved their consumption.\n",
      "The stores are on track to phase out fossil fuels for heating. All new stores are low-energy buildings, while existing stores will be further energy-renovated to a proven recipe. This involves improving insulation and airtightness and the application of sustainable technologies like propane cooling, heat recovery and heat pumps for heating, ventilation and cooling. Where possible, the installation of solar panels is being accelerated.\n",
      "Stores took additional temporary measures to save energy, like lowering indoor temperatures and light intensity, or temporarily placing back the flaps at the entrance to the cooled fresh food sections in Colruyt stores.\n",
      "In the offices too, the temperature was lowered. The heating starts later in the morning and is reduced to a minimum at weekends. Adjusted motion detection on the lighting ensures that lights are switched off faster.\n",
      "In various distribution centres, the large central boilers were replaced by more economical systems with multiple heating units.\n",

The outdated former headquarters of Thomas Cook was thoroughly renovated into a modern, energy- efficient and pleasant workplace for almost 400 employees of the IT and personnel department, Bike Republic, SmartWithFood and Jims. There is also room for flexible work, while the right-hand wing (2.000 m²) is rented to third parties.

      "Maintaining trust\n",
      "Corporate Marketing worked hard in the past financial year to maintain the high level of trust in Colruyt Group that is widely shared in society.\n",
      "More intensive internal communication, so as to create greater inter-connection between employees in a large and diverse company, especially between management and employees. To capture their needs and concerns, this included organising more than twenty lunch sessions, during each of which fifteen employees exchanged ideas with members of management.\n",
      "New initiatives to share the Colruyt Group story with business partners. On the very first business partner day at the end of May, 150 direct suppliers received an insight into the group’s strategic plan and into how we want to grow further as an innovative, sustainable and Belgian company. From mid-2023, we will also be informing the same partners by email about relevant evolutions and achievements in the group.\n",
      "In a challenging, competitive job market we updated our employer branding proposition, with the aim of maintaining our image as the best employer in Belgian retail.\n",
      "We continued our rollout of the Eco-score, making it ever easier for our customers to consume consciously. The simple colour and letter code indicating products’ environmental impact features clearly on the packaging of more than 500 private- label products and on the electronic price labels in our stores. Customers can consult the scores on all our digital media. We also encourage our national brand suppliers to mark their products with Eco-scores. In May 2023, Danone was the first to commit to using the Eco-Score in order to encourage customers to make more environmentally conscious purchases.\n",
      "Saving points for the environment\n",
      "At the end of 2022, we launched a programme that allows customers to save points every time they purchase products with Eco-score A or B. They can use the points for the environment, like for planting a tree, laying out a piece of flower meadow or following a workshop at Colruyt Group Academy.\n",
      "We consulted experts for selecting a group of environmental projects and partners, including BeeOdiversity, GoodPlanet and Nassonia. Later we will go on to choose projects that match our other sustainability themes of animal welfare, health and society.\n",
      "We are positioning the savings programme more firmly in the market, including spotlighting products with good environmental scores and making them more visible on the shelf.\n",
      "We also encourage customers to use their points effectively, for example through notifications in their Xtra app.\n",
      "Corporate Marketing streamlines the communication on the Eco-score, in collaboration with the store formats, numerous internal departments and Collibri Foundation, our foundation that will eventually manage all projects from the sustainable savings programme.\n",
      "Flexible organisation\n",
      "In the past financial year, Marketing Communication Services’ production volumes fell markedly, with reduced demand from our store formats for leaflets and other marketing communication. The department exhibited the necessary flexibility in handling the fluctuating work volumes,\n",
      "like by using freelancers. A number of communications requiring specific know-how were outsourced to external communications agencies under longer-term arrangements.\n",
      "Significant savings have been achieved, among them in the cost of digital storage of photos and videos. Overall, images are now automatically removed from the servers more rapidly.\n",
      "Creating and collaborating more efficiently\n",
      "The department and all group marketing services will start using a comprehensive programme in the course of 2023, with major efficiency gains for more than 400 employees. This programme will support the creation processes, from briefing to correction rounds to final approval and archiving. The reuse of existing content will also become a lot easier, for example via an accessible image bank and fixed templates for recurring communications.\n",

      "For positions during the 2022/23 financial year that are not in line with the 2020 Code, the reasons for deviating from the 2020 Code have been stated by the Board under the comply or explain principle. We give below the following disclosures and deviations from the principles and provisions of the 2020 Belgian Code on Corporate Governance as applicable to listed companies. Most of the deviations are due to the fact that the Colruyt family is the main reference shareholder of Colruyt\n",
      "Group. The Colruyt family wants to concentrate fully on guiding all companies of the group and wants to propagate in them the values of sustainability and sustainable entrepreneurship.\n",
      "In addition, the reference shareholder places stability and long-term vision above short-term profit.\n",
      "Principle 1 - For managing the Company, the Board has opted to continue the existing one-tier board model, consisting\n",
      "of a Board of Directors that can perform all actions with the exception of those reserved for the General Meeting. The Board of Directors has delegated part of its decision- making powers to a managing director for operational implementation. Every five years, the Board will conduct a thorough reflection on the governance structure.\n",
      "Principle 2 - The powers of the members of the Management Committee, other than the CEO, are determined by the\n",
      "CEO and not by the Board of Directors. This deviation from provision 2.19 of the 2020 Code is explained by the fact that the members of the Management Committee exercise their duties under the leadership of the CEO, to whom day-to- day management and additional specific powers have been delegated by the Board of Directors.\n",
      "Principle 3 - In line with the longstanding tradition of Colruyt Group, Jef Colruyt is simultaneously Managing Director, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Colruyt Group Management Committee and the Future Board. This departure from provision 3:1 of the 2020 Code is justified in the light of the history of Colruyt Group and the\n",
      "desire of the reference shareholders to entrust the leadership of the Management Committee to one of their own. Where appropriate, strict application of the conflict of interest\n",
      "rules protects all shareholders from any abuse. In addition, within the Board of Directors the Chairman applies the rule of a unanimous vote for every decision or investment with material consequences for the future of the group.\n",
      "Principle 3 - At the end of financial year 2022/23, the Board of Directors is composed of one executive director and eight non-executive directors, three of whom are independent directors. The three independent directors meet the independence criteria as set out in the 2020 Code and the Code on Companies and Associations. The Board of Directors believes that any increase in the number of members should be accompanied by an enrichment in experience and skills, without jeopardising its efficient operation.\n",
      "Since the Board functions and takes its decisions as a collegial body, only the general attendance rate of the Board and its committees is given, with no information about the attendance rate of each director individually.\n",
      "The Board does not consider it opportune for the non-executive directors to meet annually without the CEO, because Jef Colruyt, in his capacity as executive director, is both Chairman of\n",
      "the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Colruyt Group Management Committee, and therefore has contacts with directors and senior management as well as access to the documentation and records of all bodies.\n",
      "Principle 4 - The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee composed of one independent and two non- executive directors. Based on the current composition of the board as well as the various skills present, this composition is optimal for the efficient operation of this committee.\n",
      "Principle 4/5 - Notwithstanding provision 4.19 of the 2020 Code, the Board of Directors has not established an Appointments Committee. Appointments therefore remain\n",
      "the responsibility of the entire Board of Directors. Prospective directors are proposed to the General Meeting by the entire Board of Directors. Managers are appointed at the proposal of the Chairman of the Management Committee, with the approval of the entire Board of Directors. The limited number of directors means that this procedure works perfectly well.\n",
      "Principle 7 - The Board of Directors has opted not to grant share-related payments to directors or executive management. Non-executive directors do not receive remuneration in the form of shares of the company and\n",
      "members of the executive management are not required to hold a minimum threshold of shares in the company.\n",
      "This deviation from provisions 7.6 and 7.9 of the 2020 Code is justified, since the Board of Directors has a dual role in our one-tier board model, which is to support entrepreneurship on the one hand and to ensure effective supervision and control on the other. To avoid the granting of shares to non- executive directors increasing the likelihood of a conflict of interest, these persons do not receive performance-related remuneration or share-related compensation. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that the directors and executive\n",

      "With regard to provision 7.12 of the 2020 Code, the Board of Directors has decided for the time being not to avail itself of the option to reclaim variable compensation paid or to withhold payment of the same, as considerable uncertainty remains as to the legal validity and enforceability under\n",

To ensure their commitment and constructive involvement in decision-making, the performance of the directors is also evaluated on an ongoing basis.\n",
      "Pursuant to the new Code on Companies and Associations, the articles of association may provide for double voting rights for registered shares that have been held by the shareholder for a minimum of 2 years. In view of their administrative complexity, the Board of Directors has decided not to propose double voting rights at this stage.\n",

      "Colruyt Group carefully applies Article 3:6 (§2.6° and §4) of the Code on Companies and Associations regarding information on the diversity policy pursued. In general terms, an equality principle is applied within Colruyt Group, whereby each employee is selected and coached in their career development based on factors such as competences, talents and skills.\n",
      "As a result, our diversity policy forms part of our DNA and emanates from our core value ‘respect’. The group is convinced that diversity of employees (including in terms of age, gender, cultural and professional background) is an absolute asset for a fresh, agile and growing company. A company which also operates in a society characterised by diversity. We endeavour to display this throughout the organisation, including in the management teams. Aiming for teams that are as diverse\n",

      "At the end of financial year 2022/23, the Company’s Board of Directors was composed of representatives with sufficient diversity in backgrounds, competences and experience to support the development of Colruyt Group. In this way, the board members representing the family shareholders can present a thorough knowledge of the company. Director Jef Colruyt has held several roles in the company since 1984, becoming Chairman of the Board of Directors at the end of 1994 and since then managing the entire operation as CEO.\n",
      "Director Wim Colruyt has an IT-technical background and is well versed in business architecture. Director Hilde Cerstelotte is an expert in work simplification and director Lisa Colruyt is well versed in strategic marketing. Directors Frans Colruyt and Griet Aerts have played active roles within the group in the past. As COO Retail, Frans Colruyt managed all retail activities in the group, while Griet Aerts led Colruyt Group Academy and is now CFO of the family holding company Korys.

      "NV, (iv) independent director Chantal De Vrieze, permanent representative of 7 Capital SRL and (v) independent director Rika Coppens, permanent representative of Fast Forward Services BV.

      "of the market so as to achieve a remuneration package that is sustainable in the long term.\n",
      "The remuneration package also includes a market-based package of benefits, namely:\n",
      "Group insurance;\n",
      "Disability insurance;\n",
      "Hospitalisation insurance;\n",
      "Company car and;\n",
      "Flat-rate expense allowance.\n",
      "The diagram below shows the relative portions of the fixed salary, the variable pay and the group insurance in the target remuneration package (assuming 100% achievement of the target performance criteria) for the CEO and the members of the Management Committee (excluding CEO). The ratio of fixed\n",
      "salary/variable pay/group insurance may vary between the members of the Management Committee.\n",
      "At Colruyt Group, we believe that people make the difference and that they are intrinsically motivated to become better at what they do, to learn and develop themselves, both professionally and personally. Colruyt Group Academy provides an extensive collective training offering. We also offer individual counselling and orientation programmes.\n",
      "Finally, we also consider it crucial to offer our people a sustainable context where a pleasant working atmosphere, room for initiative and a balanced work-life balance are paramount.\n",
      "VARIABLE PAY\n",
      "In order to establish a direct link between remuneration and performance of both employee and organisation,\n",
      "a significant part of the remuneration package consists of a variable remuneration.\n",
      "TARGET LEVEL\n",
      "In order to establish a direct link between remuneration and performance of both employee and organisation, a significant part of the remuneration package consists of a variable remuneration:\n",
      "Collective variable pay\n",
      "individual variable pay.\n",
      "PERFORMANCE CRITERIA\n",
      "70% of the annual variable remuneration of the CEO and the other Management Committee members is determined\n",
      "according to collective criteria based on the operating profit targets of Colruyt Group. The Board of Directors determines every four years what level of operating profit we set as the target level. In setting this target level, performance relative to other retail companies is also taken into account.\n",
      "Operating profit as the financial performance criterion reflects Colruyt Group’s ambition to create added value in a sustainable way. Any good company needs to generate a\n",
      "profit to continue to grow in a sustainable way. By focusing on profitability, we generate sufficient cash to continue investing in the long term and thus realise our strategy. In order to give priority to the group interest, these performance criteria apply to the entire Management Committee and also form the basis for determining the level of profit-sharing for all employees of Colruyt Group Belgium.\n",
      "The remaining 30% is determined by individual criteria\n",
      "including, in particular:\n",
      "− Assisting in defining Colruyt Group’s mission & strategy, with a focus on sustainability and value creation\n",
      "− Translating the group’s mission and making the vision, mission, ambition, strategy explicit in one’s own management area and/or operating unit\n",
      "− Creating connections centred on mission, ambition and strategy\n",
      "− Attention to own development\n",
      "− Continuous attention to the sustainable creation and development of human potential, including own succession\n",
      "− Mentoring and coaching employees\n",
      "− Creating commitment and promoting Colruyt Group’s values and culture\n",
      "Finally, an additional sum may be addressed by the Chairman of the Management Committee on top of the aforementioned variable pay. This sum can amount to a maximum of 10%\n",
      "of the fixed basic compensation. Management Committee members can earn an additional bonus if they meet pre-set targets.\n",
      "These are linked to:\n",
      "− Qualitative business KPIs at the level of the management area and/or operating unit being managed. These KPIs, where relevant, are linked to sustainability.\n",
      "The individual performance criteria and KPIs are determined annually for each individual and embody the various levers identified from the strategic objectives. For the CEO and COO, these performance criteria are drawn up by the Board of Directors. For the other Management Committee members, these are proposed by the Remuneration Committee on the basis of recommendations from the CEO/COO and validated by the Board of Directors.\n",
      "EVALUATION\n",
      "If the group’s EBIT falls for the relevant financial year below a certain threshold, then, on the recommendation of the Board of Directors, no collective or individual variable pay is paid.\n",
      "Depending on Colruyt Group’s EBIT percentage, a multiplier is applied to the collective variable pay at target level. It can therefore be higher or lower than 1 but at most 1,75.\n",
      "In addition to EBIT, individual performance also plays a role in determining total variable pay. The CEO and Management Committee members are evaluated annually, in the first few\n",
      "months following the end of the financial year. For the CEO and COO, performance is evaluated by the Board of Directors. For the other Management Committee members, their performance, on the basis of recommendations from the CEO/COO, is evaluated by the Remuneration Committee and validated by the Board of Directors.\n",
      "The amount of the variable remuneration of each Management Committee member is determined as follows, depending on their individual evaluation:\n",
      "− If the Management Committee member has achieved less than half of the individual performance criteria:\n",
      "o up to half the collective variable remuneration can be awarded\n",
      "o but no individual variable remuneration will be awarded\n",
      "− If the Management Committee member has achieved half of the individual performance criteria:\n",
      "o up to half the collective variable remuneration can be awarded\n",
      "o half of the variable remuneration resulting from the achievement of the individual performance criteria can be awarded\n",
      "− If the Management Committee member has achieved more than half of the individual performance criteria:\n",
      "o the collective variable remuneration can be awarded in full\n",
      "o the variable remuneration resulting from the achievement of the individual performance criteria can be granted only pro rata to the criteria achieved.\n",
      "In the event of the additionally agreed KPIs being achieved, the CEO may award an additional bonus from the discretionary budget. It is evaluated in the same way as the individual performance criteria.\n",
      "OTHER PROVISIONS\n",
      "The Extraordinary General Meeting of 13 October 2011 decided to make use of the authorisation provided by Article 7:91 of the Code on Companies and Associations (formerly Article 520ter of the Companies Code) and expressly decided not to apply the provision regarding the permanent acquisition of shares and share options or the provision regarding the staged payment of the variable remuneration to all persons covered by these provisions. Article 13 of the articles of association was\n",
      "amended accordingly. The company will therefore not be bound by the restrictions stipulated by Article 7:91 of the Code on Companies and Associations regarding the staged payment of the variable remuneration to the executive management.\n",
      "In Belgian law, there is still considerable uncertainty as to the legal validity and enforceability of a right of recovery, in favour of the company, of variable remuneration. For this reason, Colruyt Group has opted to refrain for the time being from regulating on a right of recovery of the variable remuneration.\n",
      "The variable remuneration of the members of the Management Committee does not include any share-related remuneration. The long-term focus is part and parcel of our day-to-day operations, in part because of our focus on sustainability.\n",
      "DIRECTORS\n",
      "The directors are remunerated with a fixed remuneration (emolument), regardless of the number of meetings of the Board of Directors or one of its committees. We assume that a director works between 20 and 25 days a year in his or her director’s role. We believe that structuring the board and its committees with a single clear and transparent remuneration for the efforts of the directors is more desirable for corporate governance in a listed company. The Board of Directors has\n",
      "a collective responsibility and we also want to approach the remuneration of the directors from this perspective.\n",
      "In line with previous years, non-executive directors at Colruyt Group did not receive any share-based remuneration. This deviation from the recommendations of the Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020 is in our view justified, since the Board of Directors has a dual role in our one-tier board model,\n",
      "which is to support entrepreneurship on the one hand and to ensure effective supervision and control on the other. To avoid the granting of shares to non-executive directors increasing the likelihood of a conflict of interest, these persons do not receive performance-related remuneration or share-related compensation.\n",
      "Remuneration report for the 2022/23 financial year\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "A general overview of the company’s performance and the main environmental factors, relevant events, developments and decisions that have influenced this can be found in the management report (pages 25-41).\n",
      "REMUNERATION OF THE CEO\n",
      "(CHAIRMAN OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE)\n",
      "The remuneration paid directly or indirectly to the CEO in financial year 2022/23 comprised:\n",
      "The CEO benefits from a supplementary pension plan. This supplementary pension plan is of a defined contribution type, with Colruyt Group paying an annual contribution of 18% of the basic remuneration.\n",
      "Other components consist solely of a flat-rate expense allowance. This is not included in the above table.\n",
      "The basic salary was increased by 3,58% as of the 2022/23 financial year. The increase is entirely due to indexation. This indexation is equal to the indexation implemented for Joint Committee 200 in January 2022. This joint committee defines the applicable indexation once a year in January.\n",
      "The variable remuneration in cash for services in financial year 2021/2022 and paid out to the CEO in financial year 2022/23 dropped by 38,2% in comparison to that paid in financial year 2021/22.\n",
      "The lower variable remuneration is due to the extent to which the collective target, EBIT ratio, was not achieved for financial year 2021/22. Variable pay did not fall proportionately as much as the collective performance criterion, operating profit, because of, on the one hand, the granted individual variable pay component and, on the other, the increase in basic\n",
      "salary due to indexation. Allocation of the individual variable compensation component is in line with the remuneration policy. The individual performance criteria in terms of strategy, sustainable value creation and succession planning were, as in the previous financial year, positively assessed given the achievement of predefined objectives.\n",
      "The pay ratio within Colruyt Group is 2,34%. This is the ratio of the lowest Belgian salary in the group to the CEO’s salary.\n",
      "When using the average salary for the comparison, this pay ratio is 3,42%. The pay ratio increased significantly compared to financial year 2021/22. This is due to:\n",
      "On the one hand, the decrease in the CEO’s total package because of the decrease in variable pay, and on the other hand\n",
      "The general increase in workers’ pay through indexation because of high inflation.\n",
      "It should be noted that, as in previous years, the CEO’s remuneration (under his service contract) is taken here as the cost of the package, while for employees this is the gross pay excluding employer’s social security contributions. In this calculation, we have included only employees in Belgium who worked continuously for a full year during the 2022/23 financial year.\n",
      "REMUNERATION OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\n",
      "We list the changes in composition and responsibilities of the Management Committee that occurred during financial year 2022/23:\n",
      "Marc Hofman transferred his responsibilities as COO Food Retail as of 1/4/2022 and has not been a member of the Management Committee since then.\n",
      "Jo Willemyns assumed these responsibilities on the Management Committee as COO Food Retail & Marketing Services as of 1/4/2022\n",
      "Stefan Goethaert assumed responsibilities on the Management Committee as COO Fine Food, Business & Group Services as of 1/4/2022\n",
      "Jef Colruyt assumed additional responsibilities as COO\n",
      "Non-Food, Real Estate & Energy & Corporate Services on the Management Committee as of 1/4/2022.\n",
      "Dieter Struye had been a member of the Management Committee as General Manager Non-Food Retail since financial year 2017/18. He will no longer serve on the Management Committee as of 1/2/2023.\n",
      "The remuneration paid directly or indirectly to the other members of the Management Committee in financial year 2022/23 comprised overall:\n",
      "Basic remuneration (1)\tEUR 3.747.585\n",
      "This basic remuneration also includes the remuneration granted to the General Manager Non-food (Dieter Struye) following the termination of the cooperation on 31 January 2023.\n",
      "The members of the Management Committee benefit from a supplementary pension plan. This supplementary pension plan is of the defined contribution type, with Colruyt Group paying an annual contribution of 18% of the monthly salary x 13,92. This amount includes additional individual pension commitments.\n",
      "Other components consist solely of a flat-rate expense allowance. The members of the Management Committee are also entitled to other benefits, such as disability insurance, hospitalisation insurance and a company car. These are not included in the above table.\n",
      "These figures show the remuneration in gross amounts for a complete financial year.\n",
      "All Management Committee members included in the overview above are salaried persons. Social security contributions are paid by Colruyt Group on their gross salaries.\n",
      "Total basic remuneration increased 10% over last financial year. Underlying this, the fact that Marc Hofman was no longer a member of the Management Committee as of financial year 2022/23 is offset by the termination of the collaboration\n",
      "with Dieter Struye in the last quarter of the financial year. The basic remuneration of the other members of the Management Committee increased by just over 10%, mainly explained by the statutory indexation of the basic remuneration due to high inflation.\n",
      "The variable remuneration covers payment for services rendered to the group during financial year 2021/22. Compared to the last financial year, the number of Management Board members on which the figures are based remained stable.\n",
      "We saw a sharp decline in the collective performance criterion, operating profit, for financial year 2021/22, resulting in a decreased variable remuneration. Variable pay did not fall proportionately as much as the collective performance criterion, operating profit, because of, on the one hand, the granted individual variable pay component and, on the other, the increase in basic salary due to indexation.\n",
      "The decrease in employer contributions for the group insurance of members of the Management Committee, despite inflation, is due to the decrease in the number of FTEs in the Management Committee, with Marc Hofman’s responsibilities being redistributed among other members of the Management Committee. The same factor also explains the decrease in\n",
      "flat-rate expense allowances granted to members of the Management Committee during financial year 2022/23.\n",
      "INFORMATION ON SEVERANCE PAYMENTS\n",
      "Managers who are members of the Management Committee and bound to their employer by employment contracts have no individual contractual claims with respect to Colruyt Group regarding their severance payment.\n",
      "EVOLUTION OF THE REMUNERATION OF CEO AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OF THE PERFORMANCE OF COLRUYT GROUP\n",
      "For the calculation of total remuneration and variable remuneration, we operate here with the accumulated salary. This means that we always take into account the variable remuneration paid in year X+1, which was accumulated in year X.\n",
      "The method used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions (incl. CO2) was adjusted for the past and present. We refer for more detail to the Corporate Sustainability\n",
      "section under SDG 13 - Climate Action in the annual report for financial year 2022/2023.\n",
      "This is based on the total remuneration as stated in the consolidated annual report divided by the total number of FTEs.\n",
      "As mentioned in footnote (1), we work with the accumulated salary in the above table.\n",
      "The basis for this is that the variable remuneration paid in financial year 2022/23 is determined on the basis of\n",
      "performance in financial year 2021/22. This approach simplifies comparison between the group’s results and the remuneration paid. In this way, the total remuneration stated above for financial year 2021/22 consists of the fixed salary, contributions to group insurance and other components received in financial year 2021/22, supplemented by the variable pay received in financial year 2022/23.\n",
      "The variable remuneration in cash for services in financial year 2021/2022, paid out in financial year 2022/23, dropped sharply in comparison to that paid in financial year 2021/22. The\n",
      "lower variable remuneration is primarily due to the decrease in the financial year 2021/22 EBIT ratio compared to financial year 2020/21. The EBIT ratio is the basis for collective variable\n",
      "remuneration. Consequently, we see, for both the CEO and other Management Board members, a decrease at the level of total remuneration.\n",
      "Average remuneration per FTE increased during the past financial year because of high inflation and related index increases combined with a more or less stable number of employees.\n",
      "In addition to financial results, Colruyt Group focuses strongly on the creation of social added value and sustainability. We refer to the Corporate Sustainability section for more details on the sustainability objectives and results achieved.\n",
      "REMUNERATION OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EMOLUMENTS\n",
      "All directors of the group receive emoluments as payment for their mandates. On the advice of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided to keep the directors’ individual emoluments for financial year 2022/23 at the same level as the previous financial year.\n",

      "Risk management and internal controls\n",
      "Risk philosophy\n",
      "Colruyt Group aims to pursue a policy of sustainable entrepreneurship. In practice, this policy is converted into the strategic and operational objectives of the group and of each division within the group. Colruyt Group’s activities are exposed to a number of internal and external risks, or uncertainty factors that may affect the group’s ability to achieve these strategic and operational objectives.\n",
      "The Group believes that risk management should be an integral part of the organisation’s culture . Thus, it creates an environment in which people are motivated to recognise and deal with risks with the necessary transparency.\n",
      "The Group as a whole has a low to medium risk appetite, while each business unit within the Group has its own risk appetite in line with its objectives.\n",
      "The Group’s risk management focuses on the one hand on risk awareness and on controlling and/or limiting the most serious risks or threats, while also giving room to take manageable risks in pursuit of strategic objectives.\n",
      "Controlling these strategic risks is a core task of each member of the Management Committee, within their domain of responsibility. To assist management, the group has set up a series of risk management systems with the aim of providing reasonable certainty in the following domains:\n",
      "realisation of strategic objectives\n",
      "protecting the health and safety of consumers and staff\n",
      "safeguarding the reputation of Colruyt Group and its brands\n",
      "effectiveness and efficiency of business processes\n",
      "reliability of financial reporting\n",
      "compliance with applicable laws and regulations\n",
      "monitoring the impact of Colruyt Group on its environment\n",
      "This section of the annual report covers the main features of these systems. The principles enshrined in the COSO and ISO reference frameworks have served as a source of inspiration for the group in setting up these risk management systems.\n",
      "Components of risk management and internal control systems\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "The Board has overall responsibility for monitoring risks and maintaining a robust system of risk management and internal control. The Board recognises the importance of identifying and actively monitoring market, strategic, operating, financial and compliance risks and other longer-term threats, trends and challenges to the company. The Audit Committee supports the Board of Directors in risk management and is responsible for assessing the effectiveness of risk management and internal control processes throughout the year.\n",
      "Members of the Management Committee are responsible for day-to-day risk management within their respective business units. Management Committee members thus identify, together with their respective teams, key and emerging risks and ensure their internal follow-up and monitoring. In addition, the Management Committee focuses on evaluating proposed risk management strategies, as well as the design, implementation and evaluation of internal control.\n",
      "Risk management process\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\n",
      "Colruyt Group has developed a group-wide risk management system based on the principles of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) under the name of ‘CORIS’ (Colruyt Group Opportunity & Risk Management). The main objectives are to increase the risk awareness of management and to draw up an inventory of the risks to which the group and its subsidiaries are exposed, with a view to controlling them.\n",
      "We want to encourage our employees to take controlled risks, especially as entrepreneurship is based on conscious\n",
      "risk-taking. All group operating units have gone through the\n",
      "C process described below, and update this on a regular basis.\n",
      "RISK CULTURE\n",
      "Colruyt Group applies an integrated risk management approach based on the ‘three lines of defence model’. This model determines how specific responsibilities can be assigned within the organisation to achieve Colruyt Group’s objectives and manage the associated risks. This approach contributes\n",
      "to strengthening the risk culture, taking responsibility for the management of risk and internal control, and further optimising and integrating independent control functions (risk management compliance, internal audit).\n",
      "First line - ownership and management of risks and their control: The company itself is responsible for all the risks emanating from its own processes and must ensure their identification and effective controls. In this area, the company ensures\n",
      "that proper controls are in place, that the company’s self- assessment is of sufficient quality, that adequate risk awareness exists, and that sufficient resources are assigned to risk issues.\n",
      "Risk management is an integral part of the Group’s operations. It ranges from day-to-day financial and operational management - including the four-eye principle -, the analysis of new investment cases to the formulation of strategy and objectives.\n",
      "Risk management is thus the responsibility of all levels of the organisation, with different responsibilities at each level.\n",
      "Second line - continuous monitoring of risks and their control: These functions provide support to the business and management by applying expertise and making independent judgements of the risks faced by Colruyt Group. These functions provide assurance that the business itself (through first-line management) is in control of its risks. Naturally, primary responsibility still lies with the first line.\n",
      "Third line - provision of an independent audit system:\n",
      "Internal Audit can be understood as an independent assessment function embedded in the organisation and tasked with investigating and evaluating the proper functioning, effectiveness and efficiency of Colruyt Group’s processes, procedures and activities. This may cover areas such as operating processes, financial transactions and compliance with applicable accounting and other regulations and management. Through this independent review, Internal Audit provides assurance to the Audit Committee on the operational effectiveness of the first- and second-line risk management and internal control processes. In addition, the risk management function is evaluated once a year by an independent consultant, with the results presented to the Board of Directors.\n",
      "PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY\n",
      "The entire group is divided into Operating Units (OUs). Each operating unit must go through the following process steps in a structured manner. This process is also performed at Colruyt Group level.\n",
      "A risk coordinator is appointed for each operating unit, tasked with providing support to the risk owners. Moreover, a knowledge-sharing network spanning Colruyt Group ensures that risk management is kept alive within the organisation.\n",
      "Risk identification\n",
      "Risk identification is done on a regular basis in preparation for OUs’ new strategic plans. The evolution of the risks already identified and any new risks arising internally or as a result\n",
      "of changes in the outside world are reviewed on an annual basis. Every major incident is also analysed with a focus on its possible recurrence and then included or not as a risk in the risk log.\n",
      "Risk assessment\n",
      "After each risk identification, the risks are assessed.\n",
      "This assessment involves mapping out the causes and consequences of a risk. Taking into account the effectiveness of the control measures introduced, the risks are scaled according to likelihood and impact. The impact scale is based on the\n",
      "risk appetite established in consultation with the respective operating unit and with the Board of Directors for the group. In order to assess the scale of the impact, four impact criteria are used: economic impact, reputational impact, and the impact on the health and safety of both consumers and employees.\n",
      "Reputation is interpreted here very broadly as the response of all possible stakeholders, whether consumers, employees,\n",
      "shareholders and suppliers, or local resident or interest groups.\n",
      "Risk management\n",
      "A risk matrix is then created for each operating unit based on the risk scores, with risks divided into critical, high, medium, low and insignificant categories. Each risk is assigned to a risk\n",
      "owner who is responsible for the design and implementation of action plans.\n",
      "Critical risks should be avoided as much as possible; if not possible, mitigation plans should be provided immediately. High risks must be accompanied by an action plan.\n",
      "Moderate risks should be monitored periodically, with action plans implemented if necessary.\n",
      "Low risks are generally accepted; quick wins may be implemented.\n",
      "All risks are recorded in the risk log of the operating unit concerned, specifying any relevant KRIs (Key Risk Indicators).\n",
      "Risk monitoring\n",
      "The risk owner is responsible for monitoring action plans and for reassessment. They report on this at least once a year to the management team of their assigned risks.\n",
      "Internal & external risk reporting\n",
      "The entire process is coordinated and facilitated by the Risk and Compliance department, in consultation with the Management Committee. Reporting takes place on a quarterly basis to\n",
      "the Management Committee and, via the Audit Committee, to the Board of Directors. The members of the Management Committee are instructed to include risk management as an explicit chapter in their periodic activity reports.\n",
      "The highest Colruyt Group risks are documented annually in the annual report. This contains an overview of the risk factors specific and important to Colruyt Group with their description and a brief overview of the management measures already\n",
      "in place to mitigate this risk. This is both for global risks and specifically for the sustainability risks we have identified.\n",
      "Measures regarding risk management and internal controls\n",
      "MAIN RISKS AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES OF COLRUYT GROUP\n",
      "The main risks relating to Colruyt Group’s operations are reflected in a risk universe divided into five categories:\n",

In addition, we are very much committed to new and long-term collaboration models in existing and new production chains. We prefer products that are certified with a focus on good management and restoration of existing ecosystems. There is a risk of our being unable to source sustainably in an optimal way owing to excessive dependence on one or a limited number of suppliers. With a lack of control on environmental and animal welfare matters, there is a risk of accidental environmental damage being caused by the group.

The group therefore pays the necessary attention to ensure that the current jobs can be performed optimally with a view to physical and mental well- being.

The latter reports on a quarterly basis on the activities performed and results.\n",

      "Closing process\n",
      "While the accounts are closed on a monthly basis, mainly for management reporting, the group financial figures are\n",
      "consolidated four times per year based on a formalised closing process. This process specifies the various steps with their respective timelines, the figures and other information to be supplied, as well as the roles and responsibilities of and the interaction between the different parties in the process.\n",
      "The process is monitored by a closing coordinator who has no further involvement in the process. At the end of each closure, the process is evaluated and adjusted if necessary. During the half-yearly and annual closure, the process also provides for coordination with external auditors at regular points in time. To support the closing process, a reporting manual has been prepared and introduced and an IFRS competence cell set up.\n",
      "Monitoring of the quality of the figures supplied\n",
      "The closing process passes through different departments such as Accounting, Financial Controlling, Consolidation and Investor Relations, the purpose of the last two being to provide information to the Board of Directors. Each department\n",
      "performs quality control as a separate function, both on the figures obtained from the previous process step and on the self-produced figures. These quality controls mainly concern links (for example with the various ledgers), reconciliations (for example of accounts), alignment of financial reporting with management and operational reporting, variance analyses\n",
      "and validation rules (for example of consolidation flows and consolidated figures).\n",
      "At the end of the closing process, the consolidated figures are analysed with respect to previous periods and fluctuations must be substantiated. The financial results achieved are also checked against the expectations in this respect. In the case of figures for publication, the printer’s proofs are aligned with the system figures provided. Lastly, there is a final check for validation by the financial management.\n",
      "Communication of financial reporting\n",
      "In order to communicate and publish information as transparently as possible, Colruyt Group publishes financial press releases on pre-agreed dates.

In July 2022, the first welfare chickens reared to these criteria arrived on Colruyt meat shelves (20% of chicken items, 7% of the total volume) and at Okay (15% of fresh chicken items, 3,6% of the total volume). Most of them stem from a new, exclusive partnership with 17 Belgian chicken farmers who are applying the criteria of the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC) step by step. The animals enjoy daylight and 40% more space, there has been a switch to a slower-growing breed, and the eggs are hatched on-farm (NestBorn).\n",

This makes the bricks easy to reuse. We intend to implement this successful technique on a larger scale.\n",
      "We commit ourselves to a Kamp C project, looking for bio-based building materials deriving from our own waste streams.\n",
      "Colruyt Group signed the Flemish Concrete Agreement to reduce the use and environmental impact of concrete. With the Living Lab Circular Concrete, we are examining how we can find the most sustainable concrete mixture for each application, using as much as possible recycled materials and re-usable prefabricated elements.\n",
      "As part of the European ICEBERG project, we are conducting research with 34 partners from ten countries on the recycling of building materials from demolition (urban mining). When the Colruyt store in Deinze was demolished in 2022, we recovered the concrete to make carbonation blocks, which absorb CO2 during production instead of emitting it. We are currently examining possible applications for these blocks.\n",
      "The EU ICEBERG project receives funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 869336.\n",
      "In 2019, we signed the Green Deal on ‘Circular Construction’. As a ‘Doer in Flanders’, we are pioneering the high-quality recycling of aerated concrete, recovering and analysing the concrete from the demolition of our buildings in 2022, which we will re-use as recycled aerated concrete afterwards.\n",
      "This project receives support from Vlaanderen Circulair in collaboration with the Innovation & Enterprise Agency (VLAIO).\n",
      "Conscious consumption\n",
      "We are helping our customers consume more consciously through our range of products and services. Using visual labels\n",
      "such as our ‘Step by step’ icons, the Nutri-Score and the Eco-score, we inform and inspire them in a quick and easy way.\n",
      "To guide our customers towards a diet with a lower environmental impact, in March 2021 we were the first retailer to introduce the Eco-score in Belgium: a simple colour and letter code representing a product’s environmental impact. Today, of all Belgian retailers, we have made the most progress in its rollout.\n",
      "The Eco-score is already to be found on the packaging of more than 500 private-label products.\n",
      "At Colruyt Lowest Prices, Bio-Planet and Okay, the Eco-score is to be found on the price label.\n",
      "Customers can consult the Eco-score on various apps and on all Colruyt Group websites.\n",
      "We are backing the Eco-score with advertising on TV, radio, online and in our stores. Our brochures are listing the Eco-score and the story behind it for more and more products.\n",
      "Market research shows that 41% of Belgian consumers know the Eco-score, with 73% correctly linking it to a product’s ecological footprint.\n",
      "Avoiding and reducing greenhouse gas emissions: scopes 1 and 2\n",
      "Thanks to the many projects within our CO2 reduction plan, we have already been able to present very good results in recent years: between 2008 and 2020, we reduced our relative greenhouse gas emissions in scopes 1 and 2 by more than 40%, relative to our revenue. To continue our efforts in a credible manner, we set new emission reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This validation confirms that our goals are contributing to the Paris climate agreement to limit global temperature rise to maximum 1,5 °C.\n",
      "Our scope 1 and 2 action plans focus on three decarbonisation levers emitting the most greenhouse gases. The bulk of our efforts aim to reduce these emissions. These levers are cooling, heating and mobility.\n",
      "less direct greenhouse gases\n",
      "(in absolute values) than in 2021.\n",
      "By 2022, we had already achieved 7,9% or 7.183 tonnes of CO2eq.\n",
      "Climate-friendly cooling\n",
      "In 2017, we started switching to natural refrigerants in our Bio-Planet, Colruyt and Okay stores. Since then, 193 stores have been equipped with installations running on propane or propene cooling. These emit 90% less CO2 than installations running on synthetic refrigerants. The switch is expected to be completed by 2030. Thanks to our leak detection system based on artificial intelligence, we can detect refrigerant leaks early, thereby also cutting our climate impact. In our logistics chain, we use self-developed liquid ice containers for fresh produce and frozen foods, with a much smaller climate footprint than refrigerated carts running on CO₂. We now avoid more than 36.000 tonnes of CO2eq emissions a year compared to 2016, when we used only CO₂ cooling carts.\n",
      "Zero-emission company vehicles\n",
      "In financial year 2022/23, emissions from our company vehicles were higher than the previous year. With the corona crisis behind us, we are now seeing more employees\n",
      "coming to the office. Moreover, due to the high cost of CNG, we were forced to temporarily run our CNG vehicles on petrol. We expect a decrease in our emissions next year due to the continued shift to electric cars. We naturally support the federal government’s goal of a complete switch to zero-emission company vehicles by 2026, provided that sufficient\n",

      "Zero-emission freight transport\n",
      "All transportation performed by our own drivers, suppliers and transport partners for Colruyt Group will be completely emission-free by 2035. Specifically, this covers the delivery of goods to our distribution centres, stores and customers. We will make our own freight transport zero-emission by 2030 using battery-electric and hydrogen- electric vehicles: i.e., no emission of CO2, nitrogen or particulate matter. By 2035, we intend to have taken the next step: our freight transport will then run entirely on green electricity and green hydrogen.\n",

      "In addition to the measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we are committed to CO2- capture via natural solutions.\n",
      "As of 2030, we aim to have net zero emissions within scopes 1 and 2. We will then be removing at least as many greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as we emit.\n",
      "Forest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n",
      "Trees extract CO2 from the air by storing it in their biomass, making them one of the most efficient solutions to halt climate change. In 2021, we therefore started planting 10.000 hectares of forest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By the end of March 2023, we had already planted 3,8 million trees on 3.000 hectares, accounting for an estimated capture of\n",

Some errors in the fuel consumption of the company cars have also been rectified. In 2022, Roelandt Group and Newpharma were fully included in the consolidation scope. For the entities that were added to Colruyt Group throughout the reported year, the emissions of a complete year were considered. A few emission factors were updated. The data for base year 2021 has been recalculated to reflect these changes. For scope 3 also, a number of methodological improvements (mainly for the calculation of the product portfolio) led to a recalculation and thus a slightly adjusted base year. The threshold for recalculation is 5%.\n",
      "Methodology\n",
      "We report our scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions data based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Standard. CO2 emission data are in the form of a calculated CO2 equivalent, defined as actual CO2 emitted plus equivalent emissions of other relevant GHGs defined by the GHG Protocol.\n",
      "Emission factors\n",
      "The emission factors used in our calculation are applied in a hierarchical manner. This means that when looking for an emission factor we first consult the ADEME database (version Base Carbone 22.0). We source location-based electricity emission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2022 edition; 2020 data) and GWP values of refrigerants from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Assessment Report (2021). For numbers relating to production processes, we use primarily ECO Invent. For emission factors not found in any of the above we use DEFRA. For the impact of our product portfolio, we mainly use Agribalyse (through Simapro). The databases used in this exercise are updated regularly. We are working towards integrating more primary supplier data to increase the quality of our data.\n",
      "Organisational boundaries\n",
      "To identify the entities and activities of Colruyt Group included in the scopes, we have applied the ‘Financial Control’ principle. This principle states that operations that are fully consolidated in the financial accounts should be included in the scopes.\n",

      "EU Taxonomy\n",
      "Classification system for sustainable activities\n",
      "The European Taxonomy Regulation (‘EU Taxonomy’) is part of the European Commission’s action plan for funding the European Green Deal. In this Green Deal, the European Union states among other things its ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero\n",
      "by 2050, making the EU climate-neutral. To achieve its targets, the European Commission foresees redirecting capital flows toward sustainable economic activities.\n",
      "The EU Taxonomy is a classification system to determine whether an economic activity can be considered sustainable. In addition, the regulation also includes a financial reporting requirement for listed companies (cf. NFRD).\n",
      "Although a ‘social taxonomy’ is set to follow, the term currently used is a ‘green taxonomy’. The EU Taxonomy Regulation currently defines six environmental objectives to which economic activities should contribute:\n",
      "Climate change mitigation\n",
      "Climate change adaptation\n",
      "The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n",
      "The transition to a circular economy\n",
      "Pollution prevention and control\n",
      "For reporting year 2022/23, companies are asked to identify which of their economic activities are potentially environmentally sustainable (‘eligible activities for the taxonomy’) with regard to the first two environmental objectives: climate change mitigation and adaptation – since only these two objectives have as yet been fully developed by the European Commission.\n",
      "This year we also reviewed these eligible activities against the technical screening criteria and minimum social safeguards defined in the EU Taxonomy. In so doing, we identified the activities that are effectively environmentally sustainable according to the EU Taxonomy (‘aligned activities with the taxonomy’).\n",
      "Finally, the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (‘Delegated Regulation’) requires companies to report the share of net turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) related to these eligible and aligned economic activities.\n",
      "The EU Taxonomy is new and quite complex. As this legislation is still under development, we are closely monitoring evolutions and organising ourselves as best as possible to comply with the new reporting requirement. In assessing our economic activities, we deliberately opted for a conservative approach.\n",
      "Scope of application for Colruyt Group\n",
      "We evaluated the economic activities of all our fully consolidated companies.\n",
      "Colruyt Group also invests indirectly in many sustainable economic activities whose disclosure is required by the Delegated Climate Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (‘Delegated Climate Regulation’), but these investments are in associated companies outside the group of fully consolidated companies. For example, together with Korys, we are investing in the energy holding company Virya Energy whose main activity is the production of renewable energy and hydrogen. In our eligible activities, we refer briefly and separately to Virya Energy’s voluntary EU Taxonomy reporting.\n",
      "Eligible activities\n",
      "Within the first two environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy, the European Union is prioritising the economic activities emitting the most CO2, as well as activities facilitating their transformation. Colruyt Group is mainly active in food and non-food retail and wholesale, as well as food service.

      "and does not significantly harm the five other environmental objectives (‘do no significant harm’).\n",
      "For reporting year 2022/23, we assessed our activities against the technical screening criteria of the first two environmental objectives: climate change mitigation and adaptation. Most of our eligible activities are related to the mitigation objective. Solely the activities ‘5.3 Construction, extension and operation of waste water collection and treatment’ and ‘8.2 Computer programming, consulting and related activities’ come under the adaptation objective.\n",
      "The following table provides an overview of the activities and their assessment against the technical screening criteria. For the requirements listed in Annex A of the Delegated Climate Regulation, we refer to the comprehensive risk assessment\n",

      "Colruyt Group’s commitment to the social minimum safeguards of the EU Taxonomy is resolutely in line with these guidelines. We evaluated the minimum social safeguards at both aggregate level and the level of our economic activities pursuant to the EU Taxonomy. Supplementing the Delegated Regulation, the report of the ‘Platform on Sustainable Finance’, an advisory body to the European Commission, was also taken into account.\n",

The Delegated Regulation requires companies to report the share of net turnover, capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenditures (OpEx) in each case.\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, our main activities do not currently come under the scope of the EU Taxonomy. As a result, a large share of our corporate activities does not currently qualify for calculating the KPIs. That said, our ambition for our retail activities is to be a point of reference for sustainable business and an inspiration for conscious consumption, throughout the value chain.\n",
      "To avoid double counting, we have always followed our financial reporting processes, eliminating intra-group transactions at the consolidated level. The complete overview of all financial information for our eligible and aligned activities is available from p. 201.\n",
      "Turnover\n",
      "Turnover in terms of the EU Taxonomy definition corresponds to the consolidated revenue of Colruyt Group, to be found in the consolidated income statement in the financial report (1) on p. 207. In accordance with accounting policies and IFRS standards, revenue from discontinued operations (activities related to DATS 24 NV) has not been included. Our valuation rules can be found in Note 1. Significant accounting policies from p. 223.\n",
      "For reporting year 2022/23, eligible turnover relates to the operations of our bike chain Bike Republic. This represents 0,42% of our total consolidated turnover. Since the activities of our bike chain passed the test against the technical screening criteria, the aligned turnover also corresponds to 0,42%.\n",
      "“Turnover” in terms of the EU Taxonomy definition is referred to as “revenue” by Colruyt Group in its financial report.\n",
      "CapEx\n",
      "The CapEx reported under the EU Taxonomy includes capital expenditure and investments resulting from business combinations for tangible and intangible assets, including capitalised development costs and assets corresponding to a right of use and excluding goodwill. The investments in DATS 24 NV that meet the CapEx definition have been taken into account until the date they were classified as discontinued operations.\n",
      "Reported CapEx as part of the EU Taxonomy may differ from other investments listed in the annual report. Colruyt Group also uses other\n",
      "‘alternative performance measures’ to provide insight into its investments.\n",
      "The total CapEx for calculating the financial KPIs can be reconciled directly with the items reported in Note 10. Intangible assets on p. 247 and 11. Property, plant and equipment on p. 249 and is composed as follows:\n",
      "(1) Note 11 includes under revaluation both the effect of indexations and changes in the lease portfolio. As part of the EU Taxonomy, CapEx includes only new additions to our lease portfolio.\n",
      "For reporting year 2022/23, total CapEx for the EU Taxonomy was EUR 524,0 million.\n",
      "Total eligible CapEx ended up at 64,64%, of which 12,46% was aligned CapEx.\n",
      "OpEx\n",
      "The OpEx definition for the EU Taxonomy is limited to:\n",
      "research and development,\n",
      "building renovation measures,\n",
      "short-term leases,\n",
      "maintenance and repair,\n",

      "discontinued operations (activities related to DATS 24 NV) were not included.\n",
      "The above interpretation does not correspond to how Colruyt Group monitors and reports OpEx in the annual financial report. For the EU Taxonomy, the composition of the reported OpEx in the current annual report differs from that of reporting year 2021/22, which included total OpEx as reported in the annual financial report. If we were to reapply last year’s method of calculation, this would lead to the following composition for reporting year 2022/23:\n",
      "The OpEx of the eligible activities would then total 4,92% and that of the aligned activities 0,32%.\n",
      "Following further fine-tuning of our EU Taxonomy reporting, the OpEx composition was brought more in line with the definition set forth in the EU Taxonomy. The OpEx for reporting year 2022/23 can be aligned with the items reported in Notes 5 and 10 and is composed as follows:\n",
      "For reporting year 2022/23, total eligible OpEx with this new definition amounted to EUR 113,0 million or 54,20% of total OpEx. Of that, 3,36% is aligned OpEx.\n",
      "Not all financial flows related to OpEx can currently be extracted from our systems. As a result, some of the reported OpEx was calculated based on financial and operational parameters.\n",

      "This analysis requires management to calculate the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows using a relevant discount rate (WACC) and terminal growth rate. For more information on the assumptions used and the sensitivity of the carrying amounts to the assumptions, please see note 9. Goodwill.\n",
      "Recognition and measurement of internally developed intangible assets\n",
      "Colruyt Group invests in internally developed innovative change programmes and IT investments. An important condition for the recognition of intangible assets related to this is the future\n",

      "basis. For more information on the carrying amount of these programmes, see note 10. Intangible assets.\n",
      "Income tax and deferred taxes\n",
      "Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future profits will be available against which the tax losses carried forward and any unused tax credits able to be carried forward can be offset. Colruyt Group sets a time horizon of five years for these estimates. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date, based on estimates of future profits. For more information on the carrying amount\n",

      "Employee benefits – IAS 19\n",
      "Each year, the defined contribution plan liabilities and annual costs are determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Discount rates and inflation rates are set at group level by management. The other assumptions (such as expected future wage increases and the chances of employees leaving) are determined at local level. All employee benefit plans are reviewed annually by independent actuaries. For additional information regarding the assumptions and the sensitivity of the carrying amount of the liabilities to the assumptions, see note 24. Non- current liabilities related to employee benefits.\n",
      "Key sources of assumptions in the next financial year are:\n",
      "Calculating the present value of lease payments and determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options\n",
      "Determining the lease term requires a certain degree of assessment. Factors considered relate to the probability that early termination options or renewal options will be exercised. All facts and circumstances relevant to assessing the lease terms are considered. Lease terms are determined with the help of the departments with relevant knowledge thereof. Based on past experience and the fact that it is commercially important to be present in a location for a longer period of time, the lease term is typically set at 9 years.\n",
      "Colruyt Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the leases. As a result, the Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR) is used to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the interest rate that Colruyt Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain\n",
      "an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset. Colruyt Group estimates the IBR using observable data (such as market interest rates) and certain entity-specific parameters.\n",

      "purely based on the ownership percentage held by Colruyt Group.\n",
      "Colruyt Group owns the majority of the shares in Virya Energy NV and considers it an associate, as in previous years. As Korys Investments NV and Colruyt Group are related parties, Colruyt is\n",

      "IAS 37 (Amendment), ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets - Onerous Contracts — Cost of Fulfilling a Contract’. The amendment specifies which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. A ‘directly related cost approach’ is applied.\n",

      "to an old version of the IASB’s Conceptual Framework with references to the current version issued in March 2018. An exception was also added to the recognition criteria in IFRS 3 with respect to liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRIC 21.

The\n",
      "amendments clarify that classification of a liability is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after\n",

The Practice Statement includes guidance and illustrative examples that assist in applying the materiality concept when making judgements about accounting policies.\n",
      "IAS 8 (Amendment), ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors - Definition of Accounting Estimates’ and IAS 1 (Amendment), ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (effective date for Colruyt Group 1 April 2023).

      "IAS 12 (Amendment), ‘Income Taxes - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction’ (effective date for Colruyt Group 1 April 2023). This amendment clarifies that where payments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognised in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and interest expense). This judgement is important in determining whether any temporary differences exist on initial recognition of the asset and liability.\n",
      "IFRS 16 (Amendment), ‘Leases - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback’ (effective date for Colruyt Group 1 April 2024). The amendments specify how a seller-lessee measures the lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback transaction in a way that it does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use retained. The amendment does\n",
      "not prescribe specific measurement requirements for lease liabilities arising from a leaseback. The initial measurement\n",
      "of the lease liability arising from a leaseback may result in a seller-lessee determining `lease payments’ that are different from the general definition of lease payments in Appendix A of IFRS 16. The seller-lessee will need to develop and apply an\n",

      "Consolidation principles\n",
      "Colruyt Group’s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries after elimination of intragroup transactions and balances and Colruyt Group’s interest in associated entities and joint ventures.\n",
      "Subsidiaries\n",
      "Subsidiaries are those entities over which Colruyt Group has control. Control exists if Colruyt Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and if\n",
      "Colruyt Group has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of these returns. In assessing whether control exists, all facts and circumstances are considered. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control effectively commences until the date that control effectively ceases.\n",
      "Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from Colruyt Group’s equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders can initially be measured at fair value or at the non- controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a case-by-case basis. Subsequent to the acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non- controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. The total result is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n",
      "Changes in Colruyt Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions between owners. The carrying amounts of Colruyt Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are subsequently adjusted directly in equity to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary.\n",
      "When Colruyt Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between:\n",
      "the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest; and\n",
      "the previously recognised carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests.\n",
      "Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for in the same manner (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost, is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ or, if applicable, the cost\n",
      "on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture.\n",
      "Associates\n",
      "Associates are those entities in which Colruyt Group has significant influence on the financial and operational policies but which it does not control or jointly control.\n",
      "The initial recognition of these investments is at cost including transaction costs. These investments are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements using the equity method from the date on which the significant influence begins until the date on which the significant influence ceases. In the event an\n",
      "indication of impairment arises after the application of the equity method, Colruyt Group calculates the amount of the impairment loss as the difference between the recoverable amount and the carrying amount of the investment in the associate. If Colruyt Group’s share of the associate’s losses exceeds the carrying amount of Colruyt Group’s interests in the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to nil in Colruyt Group’s statement of financial position and no further losses are taken into account, except to the extent that Colruyt Group incurred obligations in respect of that associate. When the associate becomes profitable again, the group’s share of the associate’s profit is recognised only when the profit cancels out the unrecognised losses.\n",
      "Joint ventures\n",
      "Joint ventures are those entities in which Colruyt Group has joint control and where such control is established by an agreement, conferring upon Colruyt Group rights to the net assets of the agreement, but no rights to the assets of the agreement and\n",
      "no liabilities arising from debts of the agreement. Joint control implies that the decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all parties sharing control.\n",
      "The initial recognition of these investments is at cost including transaction costs. Colruyt Group’s interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, from the date that joint control first exists until the date it ceases. In the event an\n",
      "indication of impairment arises after the application of the equity method, Colruyt Group calculates the amount of the impairment loss as the difference between the recoverable amount and the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture. If Colruyt Group’s share of the joint venture’s loss exceeds the carrying amount of Colruyt Group’s interest in the joint venture, the carrying amount is reduced to nil in Colruyt Group’s statement of financial position and no further losses are taken into account, except to the extent that Colruyt Group incurred obligations on behalf of that joint venture. When the joint venture becomes profitable again, the group’s share of the joint venture’s profit is recognised only when the profit cancels out the unrecognised losses.\n",
      "Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n",
      "Intragroup balances and transactions, including unrealised results on intragroup transactions, are eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "Unrealised gains from transactions with associates or joint ventures are eliminated in proportion to Colruyt Group’s interest in the associates or joint ventures. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n",
      "Business combinations\n",
      "Acquisitions of businesses (as defined by IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’) are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at acquisition date of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred to former owners of the acquiree, and equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for control.\n",
      "Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred, except when they relate to the issue of debt or equity instruments. In this case, these costs are deducted from the debt instruments and from equity respectively.\n",
      "If applicable, the consideration for the business combination includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted retroactively within the measurement period against the cost of acquisition when they qualify as adjustments due to additional facts and circumstances existing at acquisition date. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRS. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration meets the definition of a financial instrument classified as equity, it is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\n",
      "Where a business combination is achieved in stages, Colruyt Group’s previously held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date\n",
      "the group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised directly in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are\n",
      "recognised on the same basis as would be required if that interest were disposed of.\n",
      "The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’ are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:\n",
      "deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and\n",
      "measured in accordance with IAS 12, ‘Income Taxes’ and IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’ respectively;\n",
      "liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by Colruyt Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2, ‘Share-based Payment’;\n",
      "assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale at acquisition date in accordance with IFRS 5, ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, are measured in accordance with that standard.\n",
      "If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the financial year in which the combination occurs, Colruyt Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see paragraph below), and/or additional assets and/or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.\n",
      "The measurement period is the period from the acquisition date to the date Colruyt Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n",
      "Financial statements of foreign companies in foreign currencies\n",
      "To consolidate Colruyt Group and each of its subsidiaries, the financial statements of the individual subsidiaries are translated into euro, the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the group. The translation is performed as follows:\n",
      "assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from acquisitions, at the closing exchange rate of the European Central Bank at the reporting date;\n",
      "income, expenses and cash flows at the average exchange rate for the financial year (which approximates the exchange rate at the date of the transaction);\n",
      "components of shareholders’ equity at the historical exchange rate.\n",
      "Exchange rate differences arising from the translation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at the closing exchange rate at the reporting date are recorded\n",
      "as part of the consolidated other comprehensive income, under ‘Cumulative translation adjustments’ in ‘Other reserves’, except for the part attributed to non-controlling interests.\n",
      "Upon the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of Colruyt Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a joint venture that includes a foreign operation, or loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the cumulative translation adjustments in equity in respect of that foreign\n",

      "In the case of a partial disposal of a subsidiary (i.e. with no loss of control over the subsidiary by Colruyt Group), the proportionate share of cumulative translation adjustments is reattributed\n",
      "to non-controlling interests and is not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. the partial disposal of associates or joint ventures not resulting in Colruyt Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the cumulative translation adjustments is reclassified to the consolidated financial results.\n",
      "Foreign currency transactions\n",
      "Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the Company at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.\n",
      "All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.\n",
      "Gains and losses resulting from transactions in foreign currency and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.\n",
      "Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and valued on a historical cost basis are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at fair value are translated at the exchange rate applicable at the date on which the fair value was determined.\n",
      "Other significant accounting policies\n",
      "Goodwill\n",
      "Goodwill resulting from business combinations is recognised as an asset as from the date control is obtained (the acquisition date). Colruyt Group measures goodwill as the difference between:\n",
      "the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and in a business combination achieved in stages, the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and\n",

      "If, after consideration, this difference is negative, the resulting gain from a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n",
      "For investments in associates and joint ventures, the goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.\n",

      "Intangible fixed assets\n",
      "Research and development\n",
      "Expenses from research activities are recognised in the consolidated income statement when incurred.\n",
      "Expenditure related to development activities whereby the results are used for a plan or design intended for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes are capitalised if the following conditions are met:\n",
      "the technical and commercial feasibility of the product or process has been demonstrated and the product or process will be commercialised or will be used internally;\n",
      "the product or process will generate future economic benefits;\n",

      "Subsequent expenditure\n",
      "Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it results in an increase of future economic benefits derived from the use of the specific asset to which the subsequent expenditure is related. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n",
      "Amortisation\n",
      "Intangible assets with a finite useful life are subject to straight- line amortisation over their estimated useful lives. Amortisation of intangible assets only begins when assets are available for intended use.\n",
      "Intangible assets that are not yet ready for their intended use and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually. For internally developed intangible assets, this evaluation is made at least twice a year.\n",
      "For intangible assets, Colruyt Group makes a distinction between software, licences, permits, customer portfolios, internally developed intangible assets and other intangible assets.\n",
      "This distinction is expressed in a different useful life per type of intangible asset:\n",
      "externally purchased software, licences and permits: contractually defined period;\n",
      "customer portfolios arising from the acquisition of points of sale: indefinite useful life;\n",

      "The amortisation method and useful life are reviewed annually and amended if necessary.\n",
      "Property, plant and equipment\n",
      "Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of self-constructed assets includes direct labour costs in addition to\n",
      "the direct cost of material and a reasonable proportion of indirect manufacturing costs which are necessary to bring the asset into its location and state that are required for the asset to function\n",
      "in the intended way. The depreciation method, the residual value and the useful life are reviewed annually and amended if necessary.\n",
      "Colruyt Group has opted to recognise capital grants as a deduction to the cost of property, plant and equipment. Grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and that the group will comply with the conditions attached to them. These grants are taken into profit or loss over the useful life of the asset by reducing the depreciation charge.\n",
      "In certain circumstances obligations exist to dismantle and restore items of property, plant and equipment in their original state; these are therefore included in the cost or acquisition value of the item of property, plant and equipment. A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position.\n",
      "Subsequent expenditure\n",
      "Costs for the replacement of a component of property, plant and equipment are capitalised provided that the cost to be capitalised can be reliably determined and that the expenditure will result in a future economic benefit.\n",
      "Costs which do not meet these conditions are immediately recognised in the consolidated income statement when incurred.\n",
      "Depreciation\n",
      "Property, plant and equipment are subject to straight-line depreciation in profit or loss based on the estimated useful life of each component.\n",
      "Tangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not depreciated but tested for impairment annually.\n",
      "The estimated useful lives are defined as follows:\n",
      "land: indefinite;\n",
      "buildings: 20 to 30 years;\n",
      "fixtures: 9 to 15 years;\n",
      "fittings, machinery, equipment, furnishings and vehicles: 3 to 20 years;\n",

      "An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised on disposal (i.e. on the date when the recipient obtains control) or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.\n",
      "Leases\n",
      "For all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised on the date on which the leased asset is made\n",
      "available for use. Right-of-use assets are recognised as part of property, plant and equipment and lease liabilities are reported as part of interest-bearing liabilities, recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for remeasurement of lease obligations.\n",
      "The lease liability is measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at a predetermined discount rate. Colruyt Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease contract or, when the latter is not available, the ‘incremental borrowing rate’ which is revised annually for new contracts.\n",
      "At initial recognition of the lease, the right of use of the assets is measured at an amount equal to the lease liability. Under certain conditions the initial direct costs for concluding the lease are included in the value of the right-of-use asset.\n",
      "The lease term is determined as the non-cancellable period of the lease, taking into account the option to extend the lease if\n",
      "that option is reasonably certain to be exercised, or the option to terminate the lease early if that option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n",
      "Lease payments are apportioned between reduction of the outstanding lease liability and finance expenses, whereby the finance expenses are recognised in profit or loss, so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term.\n",
      "Payments made for short-term leases or leases of low-value assets are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n",
      "A limited number of premises that Colruyt Group leases are subleased to third parties (the so-called ‘sublease agreements’).\n",
      "When the right of use of these assets is not fully transferred to the sublessee (which is the case, amongst others, when the\n",
      "rental period of the sublease is significantly shorter than the one of the head lease), these ‘sublease agreements’ are classified\n",

      "Colruyt Group classifies its financial assets at initial recognition in different categories. The classification of financial assets depends on:\n",
      "The characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets (SPPI test). The SPPI test is designed to determine whether or not the contractual cash flows relate to payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n",
      "The business model used for managing the financial assets determines whether the cash flow results from:\n",
      "a contractual cash flow;\n",
      "a sale of financial assets; or\n",
      "a combination of both.\n",
      "The classification of a financial asset determines the measurement of this financial asset and whether the income and expenses are recognised in profit or loss, or directly in equity. The financial assets are classified as follows:\n",
      "financial assets at amortised cost;\n",
      "financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’);\n",
      "financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).\n",
      "Financial assets at amortised cost\n",
      "Financial assets are recognised at amortised cost when the business model’s objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows\n",
      "represent (re)payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and on specified dates.\n",
      "These financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, including any transaction costs that are directly attributable to these financial assets. After initial recognition these assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, net of impairment. Each reporting period, the amount of the impairment is determined as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.\n",
      "Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n",
      "Financial assets are recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income when the business model’s objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows as well as to sell financial assets. The contractual cash flows represent (re)payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and on specified dates. In addition, Colruyt Group may irrevocably choose to recognise at fair value through other comprehensive income equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss. This choice is irrevocable and can only apply if the equity instrument is not held for trading or if it is not recognised as contingent consideration by an acquirer in a business combination. Colruyt Group makes this choice for equity instruments which it has currently no intention to sell in the short term.\n",
      "These financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, including any transaction costs that are directly attributable to these financial assets. After initial recognition these financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. In the event of a disposal of these equity instruments within this category of financial assets, the cumulative revaluations recognised through other comprehensive income are reclassified from other comprehensive income to retained earnings.\n",
      "Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n",
      "Financial assets are recognised at fair value through profit or loss when the conditions of the above categories are not met or\n",
      "when Colruyt Group has made the irrevocable choice to recognise through profit or loss debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. This choice is irrevocable and may only be used to eliminate or reduce inconsistencies in the measurement at initial recognition.\n",
      "These financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. After initial recognition the assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n",
      "Expected credit losses\n",
      "Financial assets are recognised according to the above accounting principles. At the end of every reporting period Colruyt Group assesses whether a provision for expected credit losses needs to be recognised for financial assets at amortised cost and for financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n",
      "Colruyt Group has identified two categories of financial assets to which the requirements of expected credit losses apply: trade receivables and other receivables. Expected credit losses are calculated using a model based on expected losses which represents the weighted average of credit losses with the respective default risks as weighting factors.\n",
      "To determine the expected credit losses Colruyt Group applies the simplified approach based on a provision matrix, and the general approach, under which credit losses are determined at the level of the individual receivable. The choice depends on the type of asset and the associated risk characteristics.\n",
      "The simplified approach always applies to trade receivables. These do not generally contain a significant financing component. Under the simplified approach, credit losses are estimated over the full lifetime of receivables. The calculation of percentages\n",
      "for historical credit losses is done by categories of debtors with similar risk characteristics. In addition to historical credit losses, the provision matrix used takes into account forward-looking and macroeconomic factors. See note 27.2. ‘Other risks’ for macroeconomic factors taken into account.\n",
      "The general approach applies to other receivables, i.e. to a category of receivables of limited materiality, where credit losses are determined at the level of the individual receivable. See note\n",
      "27.1.c. ‘Credit Risk’ for more information on how expected credit losses are calculated at the level of other receivables.\n",
      "Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n",
      "An asset or a disposal group (groups of assets and related liabilities) that is being disposed of, is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and\n",
      "the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. For a sale to be highly probable, the Company should be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), and an active programme to locate a buyer and to complete the sale should be initiated. The asset (or\n",
      "disposal group) should be actively marketed at a price which is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and the sale should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.\n",
      "When classified as ‘held for sale’, assets or disposal groups are valued at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell, including any impairment that might be required and which is recognised through profit or loss.\n",
      "Impairment on an asset or a disposal group is initially allocated to goodwill and then pro rata to the remaining assets and liabilities. Such an impairment loss is not allocated to inventories, financial assets or deferred tax assets which continue to be recognised in line with the other significant accounting policies of the group.\n",
      "As from the moment that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are classified as held for sale, they are no longer depreciated or amortised. Comparative balance sheet information for prior periods is not restated to reflect the new classification in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n",
      "A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or has been classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that can be distinguished operationally as well\n",
      "as for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity. The profit or loss after taxes which arises from discontinued operations is separately reported in the consolidated income statement. When operations are labelled as discontinued operations, the comparative figures in the consolidated income statement are restated to reflect a situation as if the operations had been discontinued as of the beginning of the comparative\n",
      "period, while no comparative figures are prepared for the balance sheet.\n",
      "Impairment\n",
      "The carrying amount of all assets, with the exception of inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed at least once a year and examined for any indications of impairment. If such indications exist, the related asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.\n",
      "Goodwill, tangible and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and tangible and intangible assets not available for use are tested for impairment at least annually (irrespective of whether indications of impairment exist or not). For internally developed intangible assets, this review is completed at least twice a year. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (corresponds to the money that Colruyt Group would receive as a result of a sale) and the value in use (corresponds to the cash flows that Colruyt Group expects to receive through the continuing use of the assets). For an asset for which no independent cash flows are available, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset\n",
      "belongs. For impairment testing, goodwill is always allocated to (a group of) cash-generating units.\n",
      "A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Colruyt Group defines a ‘cash-generating unit’ as the operating unit to which the asset can unequivocally be allocated. An operating unit can include a branch of the business or a business entity.\n",
      "If the recoverable amount of an asset or of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for the amount of the difference. Impairment losses relating to cash-generating\n",
      "units are first deducted from the carrying amount of any goodwill attributed to the cash-generating (or groups of) units and then deducted pro rata from the carrying amount of the other assets of the (groups of) cash-generating units.\n",
      "A recognised impairment may be reversed if it ceases to exist.\n",
      "An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill impairment is not reversed.\n",
      "Inventories\n",
      "Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and costs to sell.\n",
      "The cost of inventories is based on the ‘first in, first out’ (FIFO) principle and includes all direct and indirect costs that are required to bring the goods to their state at the reporting date, less discounts and compensations received from suppliers. The indirect costs are made up of distribution costs, i.e. handling costs at the distribution centre and transport costs, and stowage costs, i.e. the costs for store employees to fill the shelves with the goods. These respective costs are updated on a periodic basis.\n",
      "Rebates and incentives that Colruyt Group receives from its suppliers, mainly for promotions in stores, joint publicity, introductions of new products and volume incentives, are included in the inventory cost and are recognised in profit or loss as and when the product is sold, except when it relates to a repayment of specific, additional and identifiable costs which Colruyt Group incurred in order to sell the supplier’s product. In\n",
      "that case the rebates and incentives are immediately recognised as a decrease of the respective costs incurred. Estimating such supplier rebates is predominantly based on the actual revenue figures of the related period, but in certain cases requires the use of assumptions and estimations regarding specific purchasing or sales levels.\n",
      "Contract assets\n",
      "Contract assets relate to expenses made to satisfy performance obligations under a contract and are recognised at cost, less\n",
      "a provision for expected losses and less amounts of project progress billings.\n",
      "The expenses are recognised when the following conditions are met:\n",
      "the expenses are directly or indirectly attributable to a specifically identifiable contract;\n",
      "resources are generated which Colruyt Group will use to satisfy a performance obligation; and\n",
      "the expenses can be earned back.\n",
      "Expenses that can be attributed directly to a specifically identifiable project include direct labour costs and direct material costs. In addition, the cost includes an allocation of fixed and variable indirect expenses made and this based on a normal production capacity.\n",
      "Equity\n",
      "Capital and retained earnings\n",
      "Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors are only recognised as liabilities after approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Until such formal approval, the proposed dividends are included in Colruyt Group’s consolidated equity. Transaction costs of capital transactions, net of tax impact, are deducted from equity.\n",
      "Treasury shares\n",
      "Shares of Colruyt Group purchased by the Company or entities belonging to Colruyt Group, including directly attributable transaction costs, net of tax impact, are recognised as a deduction from equity. In case of a cancellation or sale of treasury shares, the result of the transaction is directly included in equity (retained earnings).\n",
      "Revaluation reserves of liabilities related to long- term post-employment benefits\n",
      "The revaluation reserves contain the cumulative actuarial profits and losses related to:\n",
      "Belgian entities:\n",
      "unemployment regime with company supplement;\n",
      "long-service benefits;\n",
      "defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return.\n",
      "Other entities:\n",
      "legal compensations\n",
      "The revaluation reserves comprise the experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.\n",
      "Cumulative translation adjustments\n",
      "The cumulative translation adjustments represent the cumulative currency translation differences that arise due to subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency that is different from the euro.\n",
      "Cash flow hedge reserves\n",
      "This reserve contains the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedge instruments related to hedged transactions.\n",
      "Reserves for financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n",
      "This reserve contains unrealised fair value changes of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n",
      "Non-controlling interests\n",
      "Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries not fully owned by the group are presented separately from Colruyt Group’s equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders can initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.\n",
      "The choice of measurement basis is made on a case-by-case basis. Subsequent to the acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. The total result is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non- controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n",
      "Provisions\n",
      "Provisions are only recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when Colruyt Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable that a future outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligations at the reporting date.\n",
      "If the effect of discounting the future cash outflows is material, the provisions are annually discounted using discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money at the reporting date.\n",
      "Restructuring provisions are recognised when Colruyt Group approved a detailed, formalised restructuring plan and made a start on restructuring or made it publicly known before reporting date. These provisions only include direct expenditures that\n",
      "are necessarily entailed by the restructuring and that are not associated with the ongoing activities of the Company.\n",
      "Environmental provisions are established in accordance with legal requirements on the one hand and the environmental policy established by Colruyt Group on the other.\n",
      "For onerous contracts, a provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position for the difference between the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the contract and the expected benefits to be derived from the contract. Before a provision for an onerous contract is established, Colruyt Group recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that contract.\n",
      "Employee benefits\n",
      "Post-employment benefits\n",
      "There are different types of post-employment benefits within Colruyt Group:\n",
      "Defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return\n",
      "In Belgium, the Law regarding supplementary pensions (‘WAP’) requires employers to guarantee a minimum return on defined contribution plans over the course of the career. For amounts until 31 December 2015, this minimum return was 3,25% on employer contributions and 3,75% on employee contributions. As a result of a law change in December 2015, the interest rate to be guaranteed is variable starting from 1 January 2016, based on a mechanism linked to the return of the Belgian OLO bond with a minimum of 1,75% and a maximum of 3,75%.\n",
      "Owing to these legal changes, and also to the fact that a clear position was taken by the regulatory instances during 2016, and given that reliable estimates can be made for these retirement benefit plans, the Belgian defined contribution plans have been considered as defined benefit plans since financial year 2016/17. They are measured in accordance with IAS 19 based on the ‘projected unit credit’ method.\n",
      "Unemployment regime with company supplement\n",
      "The possibility to retire early, as it exists within Colruyt Group for employees of its Belgian entities, is based on the ‘Unemployment regime with company supplement’ applicable in Belgium. The unemployment regime with company supplement and the conditions regarding the required age and performed service period are described in general terms in collective labour agreement No. 17 (Collectieve Arbeidsovereenkomst/Convention Collective de Travail or cao/CCT), as established by the National Labour Council (Nationale Arbeidsraad/Conseil National du Travail) and in the Royal Decree of 3 May 2007 which regulates the unemployment regime with company supplement (Belgian Official Gazette 8 June 2007). Other collective labour agreements negotiated by the National Labour Council or within Colruyt Group for specific entities or industries may be applicable, but have benefits similar to those of collective labour agreement No. 17.\n",
      "These benefits must be paid if a company decides to terminate an employee’s employment before the normal retirement date. Given that a reasonable expectation is created towards the employees at the moment of their recruitment or during the period of service, that they are entitled to join the unemployment regime with company supplement before the legal retirement age, these benefits are treated as post-employment benefits (defined benefit plan).\n",
      "Other\n",
      "Other post-employment benefits include departure benefits as a result of retirement or as a result of the application of the ’Unemployment regime with company supplement’ (Belgian entities) and legal compensations (French and Indian entities). These benefits are also treated as defined benefit plans.\n",
      "The liabilities arising from these systems and the related costs are determined using the ‘projected unit credit’ method, based on actuarial calculations that are executed at the end of each financial year. A comprehensive actuarial measurement based on updated personnel information is performed at least every three years. In the years in which no comprehensive actuarial measurement is performed, actuaries use forecasts based on the previous year but including updated assumptions (discount rate, pay rise and inflation). These liabilities, recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position, are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash outflows, based on a discount rate at the reporting date which corresponds to the market yield of high quality corporate bonds with a remaining maturity that approaches the maturity of these liabilities, decreased with the fair value of the plan assets. The liabilities\n",
      "related to the unemployment regime with company supplement are recognised for the population of employees for which can be reliably assumed that it will join the unemployment regime with company supplement. The liabilities for the defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return are recognised for all Colruyt Group employees entitled thereto.\n",
      "The costs related to these systems consist of the following items:\n",
      "the current service cost, which is the increase in the present value of the obligation resulting from employee service in the current reporting period;\n",
      "the past service cost, which is the change in the present value of the benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods, resulting from an amendment or a curtailment of the existing benefit plan;\n",
      "gains or losses on settlement of the benefit obligation, if any;\n",
      "the net interest on the net liability arising from the passage of time;\n",
      "the actuarial gains and losses, which comprise the effect of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.\n",
      "The first three items are recognised in profit or loss as ‘Employee benefit expenses’. The net interest on the net liability is included in profit or loss in the ‘Net financial result’. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n",
      "Profit participation\n",
      "In accordance with the Law of 22 May 2001 concerning employee participation in the capital of entities and the establishment of\n",
      "a profit bonus for employees, Colruyt Group offers its personnel based in Belgium a share in the profits in the form of a profit participation, paid in cash. The profit participation is recognised in the financial year in which the profit is realised.\n",
      "Discounts on share capital increases\n",
      "In accordance with article 7:204 of the Code on Companies and Associations, Colruyt Group offers a discount on its yearly share capital increase which is reserved for its employees. This discount is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the period of the share capital increase.\n",
      "Financial liabilities\n",
      "Financial liabilities are subdivided as follows:\n",
      "financial liabilities at amortised cost; and\n",
      "financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n",
      "Financial liabilities at amortised cost\n",
      "Financial liabilities of Colruyt Group measured at amortised cost comprise interest-bearing loans, trade payables and other liabilities. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. After initial recognition, these financial\n",
      "liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective interest rate basis.\n",
      "The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where\n",
      "appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n",
      "Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n",
      "Financial liabilities of Colruyt Group measured at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative financial instruments that are concluded by Colruyt Group in order to hedge its exposure to currency risks resulting from its operational activities. Colruyt Group does not conduct speculative transactions.\n",
      "These financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value including any transaction costs that are directly attributable to these financial liabilities. After initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n",
      "Derivative financial instruments\n",
      "Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. After initial recognition these derivative financial instruments are remeasured at fair value at the end of every reporting period. Derivative financial instruments can be\n",
      "subdivided into cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and hedges of net investments. Colruyt Group designates the derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges.\n",
      "At the inception of the transaction, Colruyt Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged instrument, as well as the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Derivative financial instruments are presented according to their non-current or current nature.\n",
      "The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges is included as a separate component in equity, under ‘Cash flow hedge reserves’. The gain or loss in respect of the ineffective portion is immediately recognised in profit or loss under ‘Finance income’ or ‘Finance costs’.\n",
      "The cumulative amounts included under ‘Cash flow hedge reserves’ are reclassified to profit or loss in the period during which the hedged instrument affects profit or loss. The cumulative amounts of the hedging instrument are included under the same line item as the hedged instrument.\n",
      "A cash flow hedge accounting relationship is discontinued when:\n",
      "the hedge accounting relationship fails the effectiveness test;\n",
      "the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised;\n",
      "management decides to revoke the hedge accounting designation of the instrument; or\n",
      "the forecast transaction is no longer highly probable.\n",
      "When the forecast transaction is no longer highly probable but still expected to occur, the hedge gains and losses that were previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the transaction affects profit or loss. As soon\n",
      "as the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, any gain or loss is immediately recognised in profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\n",
      "Certain derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes to the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are immediately recognised in profit or loss under ‘Finance income’ or ‘Finance costs’.\n",
      "Revenue\n",
      "Revenue is recognised based on a five-step model. Revenue from the supply of goods or services is recognised in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Colruyt Group expects to be entitled.\n",
      "Colruyt Group supplies goods, either food or non-food, through different sales channels.\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of goods – ‘Retail’\n",
      "The sale of goods in the ‘Retail’ segment, at the cash desk or online, is limited to one single transaction, i.e. the sale of goods at\n",
      "the cash desk or online. There is only one performance obligation within this context and revenue is recognised when control over the goods is transferred to the customer.\n",
      "For certain products or services, such as phone cards and tickets for amusement parks, Colruyt Group acts as an agent. Therefore, only the commission is included in the revenue.\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of gift cards and gift certificates is recognised when the gift card or gift certificate is redeemed by the customer.\n",
      "The transaction price is affected by a number of rebate mechanisms, which are recognised as variable considerations and are included in profit or loss at the time of the sale of the goods.\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of goods – ‘Wholesale and Foodservice’\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of goods in the ‘Wholesale and Foodservice’ segment is recognised upon delivery to, or pick-up by, the ‘Wholesale and Foodservice’ customer. To determine the transaction price Colruyt Group uses collaboration arrangements. Any rebates granted to the ‘Wholesale and Foodservice’ customer are deducted from the sales price.\n",
      "Revenue from the sale of goods – ‘Other activities’\n",
      "Revenue from the ‘Other activities’ segment mainly relates to revenue from the sale of fuel, the supply of printing and\n",
      "document management solutions and energy-related activities.\n",
      "The sale of fuels is limited to one single transaction that is settled at the pump. Any rebates granted are immediately deducted from the transaction price.\n",
      "Revenue from services rendered\n",
      "Revenue from services rendered other than those included under ‘Revenue from the sale of goods – ‘Other activities’’, is assessed on a contractual basis to decide whether the performance obligations are performed over time or at a specific moment in time.\n",
      "Other operating income\n",
      "Rental income\n",
      "Rental income generated by ordinary leases or by operating subleases are recognised in ‘Other operating income’ on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n",
      "Dividend income from financial assets and finance income\n",
      "Dividends received from financial assets are recognised in the consolidated income statement at the time of allocation. Finance income is recognised using the effective interest method. Fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are immediately recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n",
      "Other operating income from remuneration received\n",
      "Colruyt Group does not consider income from renewable energy, services rendered to third parties and revenue from waste recycling as part of its ordinary business activities. This item relates mainly to B2B revenues from the sale of energy, from the cleaning of transport containers and from sales of waste products (mainly plastic and cardboard).\n",
      "Expenses\n",
      "Incentives from suppliers\n",
      "Incentives from suppliers are recognised net of expenses.\n",
      "If such incentives are specifically received for the reimbursement of specific publicity expenses incurred, the reimbursements are deducted from those specific expenses. In all other cases the reimbursements are recognised as a deduction from cost of goods sold.\n",
      "Rental payments\n",
      "Payments made for short-term leases or leases of low-value assets are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n",
      "Finance costs\n",
      "Finance costs relate to interest on loans, interest on repayments of lease liabilities, fair value adjustments of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and adjustments for the time value\n",
      "of liabilities. Interest expenses are recognised using the effective interest method.\n",
      "Fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are immediately recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n",
      "All other finance costs are recognised when incurred.\n",
      "Income tax expense\n",
      "Income tax for the financial year comprises current and deferred taxes and is presented in accordance with IAS 12, ‘Income Taxes’. Taxes are presented in profit or loss, except for taxes that relate to transactions not recognised in the consolidated income statement or that relate to a business combination.\n",
      "Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the financial year, using tax rates and tax laws enacted or enacted substantively at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable (or receivable) in respect of\n",
      "previous years. These taxes are calculated in accordance with the respective tax laws applicable in all countries in which Colruyt Group operates.\n",
      "Deferred taxes are calculated using ‘the balance sheet liability method’, providing for temporary differences between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. The following differences are however not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of differences on assets or liabilities that are not resulting from a business combination and that do not affect profit before tax or taxable profit and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to the extent that the group is able to assess the timing of the expiration of the\n",
      "temporary differences and that it is probable that they will not be reversed in the near future.\n",
      "Deferred taxes are calculated using tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available in the near future against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n",
      "Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends or gains on shares in subsidiaries are only recognised respectively at the moment of the decision to pay the related dividend and at the moment of the decision of the realisation of the gain.\n",

      "Operating segments\n",
      "Colruyt Group distinguishes three operating segments within its activities.\n",
      "Since Colruyt Group refers to its CEO as the ‘chief operating decision maker’ (CODM), the operating segments, taking into account the operating characteristics of each activity, are based on the information provided to the CEO. Colruyt Group calculates its earnings from operating activities (EBIT) at segment level and recognises it in accordance with international financial reporting\n",
      "standards (IFRS). Assets and liabilities are not reported to the CODM by segment.\n",
      "Two key business segments have been identified: ‘Retail’ and ‘Wholesale and Foodservice’. The difference between both operating segments can be found in differences in markets and business models. The other identifiable segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds determined by IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’, and were therefore reported together under the operating segment ‘Other activities’. The group support activities combine various departments and supply services to the different\n",
      "brands within Colruyt Group. These activities include marketing and communication, IT, human resources and recruitment, finance and other central services. The costs of group support activities and the result of their internal cross-charging are, to the extent possible, allocated to the reported segments.\n",
      "Given that in 2022/23 the CODM monitored the performance for the full year and allocated resources including the discontinued operations as part of the ‘Other activities’, the discontinued operations are reported as part of the segment ‘Other activities’ in line with previous financial years.\n",
      "Retail\n",
      "Stores under Colruyt Group’s own management which directly sell to retail customers and bulk consumers. The filling stations in France are also included in this segment as they are inseparably connected to, and therefore an integral part of, the stores in France.\n",
      "Wholesale and foodservice\n",
      "Supply to wholesalers, commercial customers and affiliated independent merchants.\n",
      "Other activities\n",
      "Filling stations in Belgium, printing and document management and sustainable energy. The filling stations in Belgium are presented in a separate segment, as opposed to the filling stations in France, the reason being that the former, which have their own commercial objectives and energy strategy, can be identified separately from the stores in Belgium.\n",
      "The results of an operating segment contain elements which are directly attributable or which are reasonably attributable to the operating segments.\n",
      "The revenues of each operating segment include revenues from sales to external customers and revenues from transactions with other operating segments. More information can be found under note 3.1. Revenue by cash-generating unit.\n",
      "The results of the operating segments are evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT).\n",
      "The financial result and income taxes are managed at Colruyt Group level and are not allocated to the operating segments.\n",
      "Non-cash items in the income statement consist mainly of depreciation and amortisation, impairment of non-current assets, provisions and impairment of current assets. The line items ‘Depreciation and amortisation’ and ‘Impairment of non-current assets’ are the most significant ones and are therefore included in the segment information.\n",
      "The operating segment information and Colruyt Group’s consolidated figures can be reconciled by adding the information in the different operating segments with the non-allocated elements - including group support activities - eliminations within Colruyt Group and reclassification to discontinued operations.\n",

      "Goodwill\n",
      "The recognised goodwill relates to goodwill arising from the acquisition of complete business entities. For more information regarding the definition, recognition and valuation of goodwill we refer to note 1. Significant accounting policies.\n",
      "As described in the policies, goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment at the level of the cash-generating unit (CGU) in line with the provisions in IAS 36. Colruyt Group considers the business segments or business entities as CGUs. The impairment test of goodwill consists of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill, with an impairment recognised if the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount. Recoverable amounts are based on value in use. The latter is equal to the present value of the forecast cash flows of each CGU or group of CGUs and is determined using the following data:\n",
      "cash flows based on the latest forecasts, including detailed planning for revenue, EBITDA and investment planning through capital expenditure or leasing. When preparing cash flow forecasts, Colruyt Group uses estimated growth rates and expected future margins derived from the actual figures of the most recent financial year and from forecasts;\n",
      "a residual value determined from an extrapolation of the cash flow of the last year of the forecast, influenced by a long-term growth rate. To determine the residual value using the discounted cash flow method, the ‘Gordon growth model’ was used;\n",
      "discounting of expected cash flows at a rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) formula. To determine the discount rate, Colruyt Group uses the ‘Capital Asset Pricing Model’. For its impairment testing, Colruyt Group uses a minimum WACC of 8,0% or, if higher, a WACC calculated on the basis of the 'Capital Asset Pricing Model’.\n",
      "Given the importance of these assumptions for calculating value in use, a) they are monitored closely at a central level through alignment and validation processes, and b) external sources of information are used to determine them. The principal assumptions for calculating value in use for the CGUs with material goodwill are shown in the following table:\n",
      "Given all CGUs are active in retail activities in Belgium, the same WACC was calculated for all CGUs based on the ‘Capital Asset Pricing Model’. The WACC has risen to a range of 6,3% to 6,7% (versus 5,0% to 6,3% last year) as a result of an increasing risk-free rate partially offset by a decreasing Equity to Capital ratio for Colruyt Group. We also see a limited WACC increase for the peer group as a result of the decline in the beta.\n",
      "In determining the long-term growth rate, Colruyt Group takes into account internal sources of information, the evolution and expectations of the Belgian retail market and long-term inflation. In line with last year, the long-term growth rate for all CGUs was retained at 1%, with Colruyt Group expecting long-term growth to normalise.\n",
      "The impairment tests were performed in February 2023. For Newpharma Group NV, the purchase price allocation of the business combination has not yet been finalised on the reporting date. We therefore only include the provisional goodwill. Newpharma Group NV is currently being integrated into Colruyt Group's operations. At the time of impairment testing, no forecasts existed for the integrated CGU. A value in use was calculated based on a WACC of 8,0% and a long-term growth rate of 2,0% (based on external information and internal expectations for e-commerce and the relevant sector). Based on these tests and the sensitivity analysis, no impairment risk was identified.\n",
      "As a result of the impairment tests performed, no impairments were identified and there was sufficient headroom for all CGUs, with a minimum headroom in relation to the carrying amount of 32,1%. Colruyt Group is of the opinion that the above-described assumptions used for calculating the value in use provide the best estimation of future evolutions.\n",
      "Colruyt Group's models also include sensitivity analyses for gross margins, sales growth, increased operating costs, long-term growth rate, WACC and a combination of various parameters. Based on these sensitivity analyses, no impairment risk was identified for the various CGUs and consequently these sensitivity analyses indicate that a reasonably possible change in these assumptions would not result in an impairment.\n",
      "Goodwill by cash-generating unit can be presented as follows:\n",
      "Goodwill adjustment to reflect changes in estimates within the measurement period.\n",
      "For acquisitions, see note 15. Business combinations.\n",
      "The changes in ‘Goodwill’ can be explained as follows:\n",
      "Goodwill adjustment to reflect changes in estimates within the measurement period.\n",
      "Intangible assets\n",
      "As adjusted due to discontinued operations. See Note 16 for more information.\n",
      "To clarify the breakdown between internally developed intangible assets and externally purchased intangible assets, the table in note 10. Intangible assets has been adjusted for both financial years. The categories ‘Intangible assets under development and other intangible assets’ and ‘Concessions, software, licences and similar rights’ in the 2021/22 annual report have been broken down into ‘Internally developed intangible assets’, ‘Externally purchased software, licences and similar rights’, ‘Other intangible assets’ and ‘Intangible assets under development’.\n",
      "The externally purchased, software, licences and similar rights totalling EUR 20,0 million (previous reporting period EUR 24,9 million) consist mainly of purchased IT security software. The internally generated software still under development (mainly transformation programs) at the end of the current financial year totals EUR 177,0 million (compared to EUR 193,4 million for the previous financial year). During the current financial year the group acquired intangible assets for an amount of EUR 69,6 million (compared to EUR 88,2 million during the previous financial year), of which EUR 63,9 million were developed internally (compared to EUR 76,1 million during the previous financial year).\n",
      "Impairments amounting to EUR 22,2 million were realised, mainly related to the loss-making operations of Dreamland and Dreambaby.\n",
      "Non-capitalised costs related to research and development amount to EUR 55,9 million. These costs consist of externally purchased goods and services as well as internal transactions and cost allocations.\n",

      "Collateral has been provided for contracted liabilities, mainly at The Fashion Society (note 25. Interest-bearing liabilities).\n",
      "During financial year 2022/23, Colruyt Group acquired property, plant and equipment totalling EUR 406,6 million (EUR 399,4 million in financial year 2021/22). These acquisitions include the expansion and modernisation of the store network, investments in the logistical infrastructure and production departments, and in sustainable energy.\n",
      "The net carrying amount of the line item ‘Right-of-use assets’ for the current financial year amounts to EUR 303,8 million (compared to EUR 264,5 million for the previous reporting period) and consists of leases in respect of buildings (EUR 286,0 million), land (EUR 1,5 million), vehicles, machinery, ICT equipment and other tangible fixed assets (EUR 16,4 million).\n",
      "On property, plant and equipment an impairment loss of EUR 12,0 million was recognised, mainly relating to the loss-making operations of Dreamland and Dreambaby, and the expansion, relocation and renovation of existing stores. The impairment loss is included in the income statement of the current reporting period under ‘Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-current assets’ within the operating segments ‘Retail’, ‘Wholesale and Foodservice’ and ‘Other activities’.\n",
      "The grants recognised in profit or loss amount to EUR 1,4 million (EUR 1,3 million in the previous financial reporting period). The grants consist mainly of the grant awarded for the construction of the logistics site in Ath/Lessines.\n",
      "Investments in associates\n",
      "The investments in associates for the financial year 2022/23 relate to the non-quoted entities AgeCore SA (25,00%), First Retail International 2 NV (4,73%), Vendis Capital NV (10,87%), Smartmat NV (41,36%), Scallog SAS (23,73%), The Seaweed Company BV (21,30%), and Virya Energy NV (59,94%). These investments are considered as associates and are accounted for using the equity method given that Colruyt Group has a significant influence based on indicators as defined under paragraph 6 of IAS 28, ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’.\n",
      "Acquisitions and transactions with non-controlling interests mainly concern Virya Energy NV. After conversion of the convertible loan between Colruyt Group and Virya Energy NV, Colruyt Group's stake in Virya Energy NV increased from 59,78% to 59,94%. Transactions with non-controlling interests include the initial recognition of put options on non-controlling interests agreed by Virya Energy NV with the respective shareholders. This liability will be revalued at each closing date, with subsequent changes recognised in equity.\n",
      "The investment in Newpharma Group NV has been fully consolidated as a subsidiary since October 2022. This change in consolidation method is included in this note under the line item ‘Disposals’. Through the acquisition of the remaining 39% of the shares of Korys Investments NV on 14 October 2022, Colruyt Group's stake in Newpharma Group NV increased to 100%. The requisite measures were taken in the context of the conflict of interest rules.\n",
      "On 22 March 2023, Virya Energy NV announced that it had entered into an agreement with JERA Green Ltd., a subsidiary of JERA Co. Inc., to sell 100% of the Parkwind NV shares. The transaction is expected to be closed in the course of financial year 2023 and is subject to approval by the relevant competition and other regulatory authorities. This will lead to a very large one-off positive effect in Colruyt Group's consolidated net result in financial year 2023/24. That effect is estimated at EUR 600 million to EUR 700 million (based on Virya Energy NV's last closing date, i.e. 31 December 2022). The final price may still vary depending on the exact date the transaction is completed, and is expected to be at least EUR 1,55 billion (net of debt) at the level of Virya Energy NV.\n",
      "For transactions decided by the Board of Directors after year-end with regard to Virya Energy NV, we refer to note 32. Events after the reporting date.\n",
      "The investments in Scallog SAS, Smartmat NV and The Seaweed Company BV are presented under the operating segment ‘Retail’, the investment in Virya Energy NV under the operating segment ‘Other activities’ and the investments in AgeCore SA, First Retail International 2 NV and Vendis Capital NV under the segment ‘Unallocated’.\n",

      "As a result of the announced transaction to sell 100% of the shares of Parkwind NV, the requirements for IFRS 5, ‘Assets Held for Sale and discontinued Operations’ were met.\n",
      "Consequently, within the sub-consolidation of Virya Energy NV, the entire Parkwind Group is presented as such in the balance sheet and income statement per 31 December 2022. The assets of the discontinued operation amount to EUR 2.352,6 million, its liabilities to EUR 1.458,8 million.\n",

As Colruyt Group shares the control over these entities with other parties, these joint ventures are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method.\n",
      "An interest in the company Pluginvest BV was acquired during the financial year (May 2022).\n",

      "Non-current assets\n",
      "The non-current financial assets evolved as follows during the financial year:\n",
      "The financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income consist mainly of the investment in the holding company Sofindev IV NV (9,42%), the investment in North Sea Wind CV (7,19%) and the holdings in investment funds Good Harvest Belgium I SRL (4,61%) and Blue Horizon Ventures I SCSp RAIF (1,09%). The investments in the various companies are measured at fair value, calculated as the share of Colruyt Group in the equity of these companies, corrected, in the case of the investment funds, for the fair value of their own investment portfolios.\n",
      "During the current reporting period, the non-current financial assets decreased by a net EUR 3,9 million. This is mainly explained by the fair value adjustments of Sofindev IV NV of EUR -3,5 million.\n",
      "During the previous reporting period, non-current financial assets decreased by net EUR 96,9 million. This was mainly explained by the reclassification of the convertible bonds of Virya Energy NV (EUR 95,0 million) from non-current to current assets, the capital decreases for Sofindev IV NV (EUR -2,3 million) and the fair value adjustment for Sofindev IV NV (EUR -1,1 million).\n",
      "Current assets\n",
      "The current financial assets evolved as follows during the financial year:\n",
      "The equity instruments and fixed-income securities at fair value through profit or loss relate mainly to financial assets held by the Luxembourg reinsurance company Locré SA (EUR 26,5 million for the current period). The equity instruments and fixed-income securities are measured at their closing rates on 31 March 2023. Fair value adjustments are\n",
      "recognised through profit or loss. The fair value adjustment to the current assets at 31 March 2023 resulted in a net loss of EUR 0,4 million for the current financial year (compared to a net loss of EUR 0,9 million for the financial year 2021/22). The return on the fixed-income securities is 0,9% on average, with a maximum of 4,9%.\n",
      "The compound instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss in the previous financial year relate to the convertible bonds (EUR 95,0 million) issued by the associate Virya Energy NV. At the beginning of June 2022, Colruyt Group converted these convertible bonds into shares.\n",
      "The financial assets at amortised cost relate to a term deposit held by Colruyt IT Consultancy India Private Limited. The derivative financial instruments are related to the fair value of the outstanding currency hedges for cash flow hedging purposes.\n",
      "The cash flow hedging instruments are measured at their fair value at 31 March 2023. Fair value adjustments are accounted for through other comprehensive income owing to the classification as hedge accounting.\n",
      "More information on Colruyt Group’s risk management approach to investments can be found in note 27. Risk management.\n",
      "Business combinations\n",
      "On 14 October 2022, Colruyt Group increased its stake in Newpharma Group NV from 61% to 100%. Newpharma Group NV is a leading Belgian online pharmacy based in Liege and active in six countries. Since 1 October 2022, the investment in Newpharma Group NV has been fully consolidated as a subsidiary, and no longer as an associate using the equity method.\n",
      "The transaction resulted in goodwill of EUR 203,5 million. In determining this goodwill, an acquisition price of EUR 96,5 million was taken into account for the remaining 39% of the shares and equity of EUR -23,1 million. The fair value of the 61% held in the associate's capital was valued at EUR 85,7 million as at the acquisition date, which means that the resulting gain compared to the carrying amount of the associate can be considered negligible. Hence, the increased stake in Newpharma Group NV in financial year 2022/23 will have no effect on the result.\n",
      "The allocation of the acquisition price to the underlying assets of Newpharma Group NV has not yet been finalised at the reporting date and will be finalised in the course of financial year 2023/24. Part of the goodwill (estimated impact EUR 25,1 million) currently recorded is still expected to be allocated to amortisable intangible assets, mainly including the brand name. The remaining goodwill is underpinned by future synergies that will be generated by the integration of Newpharma Group NV into Colruyt Group. These synergies are generated, among other things, by new business opportunities and cost efficiencies in administrative costs.\n",
      "The requisite measures were taken in the context of the conflict of interest rules. We refer to the Corporate Governance section for more details. The acquisition balance sheet can be summarised as follows:\n",
      "There were no other material business combinations in financial year 2022/23.\n",

      "The income statement related to the operations of DATS 24 NV was reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations for both the previous (DATS 24 NV and Eoly NV) and the current financial year (DATS 24 NV). As Colruyt Group intends to continue to purchase services and products from DATS 24 NV after the latter's contribution into Virya Energy NV, the intra-group transactions between continuing operations and discontinued operations were not eliminated.\n",

      "On 31 March 2023, Colruyt Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities in an amount of EUR 61,2 million (EUR 62,6 million on 31 March 2022).\n",
      "This amount relates to temporary differences, as well as tax losses and unused tax assets carried forward totalling EUR 244,8 million (EUR 244,8 million for the 2021/22 financial year).\n",
      "Colruyt Group only recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. Colruyt Group sets a time horizon of five years for these estimates.\n",
      "The other liabilities on the asset side mainly relate to IFRS 16 lease liabilities and on the liability side to deferred tax liabilities that cannot be allocated to the other headings.\n",
      "Change in net carrying amount\n",

      "Inventories\n",
      "The inventory valuation has been updated in 2021/22 and had a one-off effect of EUR 26,1 million. The accumulated impairment on inventories of trade goods amounted to EUR 49,7 million in the current financial year compared to EUR 47,4 million in the previous financial year.\n",
      "The amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the 2022/23 income statement amounts to EUR 7.074,2 million and was reported under ‘Cost of goods sold’. Last year this expense was EUR 6.546,4 million.\n",

Recognised impairments for expected credit losses on the total of other non-current receivables amount to EUR 1,0 million (comparative reporting period EUR 2,5 million). To calculate the impairments, the general approach under IFRS 9 was used, whereby assets are assessed on an individual basis, with any impairments recorded on the basis of expected credit losses. The credit risk assessment for loans to associates and joint ventures is linked to the analysis of impairment indicators. The result of this analysis is that there are no expected credit losses for loans to associates and joint ventures. See also note 1.5.E - Financial assets - Expected credit losses.\n",

For all still due receivables, Colruyt Group applies a percentage between 0,0% and 0,5% (dependent on the category), while for receivables less than six months overdue, Colruyt Group applies percentages between 1% and 5%, dependent on the category. For receivables older than six months, Colruyt Group applies a percentage of 25% to 100%, again dependent on the category.\n",
      "For the wholesale segment, bank guarantees were received for EUR 22,2 million as well as credit insurance. These credit insurance policies cover 4,8% of the gross value of outstanding trade receivables (as at 31 March 2022, it was 2,8%).\n",

The Board of Directors was authorised by the Extraordinary General Meeting of 10 October 2019 to acquire up to 27.610.418 of the company’s treasury shares. This authorisation is valid for a period of five years. As employee commitment to the group’s growth is also one of Colruyt Group’s priorities, an annual capital increase reserved for employees has been organised since 1987.\n",

      "Share capital\n",
      "As a result of the resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of 6 October 2022, the capital was increased by 238.500 shares on 19 December 2022; this corresponds to a capital contribution of EUR 5,4 million.\n",
      "The Company’s share capital on 31 March 2023 amounted to EUR 370,2 million divided into 134.077.688 fully paid up ordinary shares without par value. All shares, except treasury shares, participate in the profits.\n",
      "The Board of Directors is authorised to increase the share capital in one or more instalments by a total amount of EUR 357,0 million, within the limits of the authorised capital.\n",
      "Capital increases undertaken under this authorisation may be by contribution in cash or kind, conversion of any reserves or issue of convertible bonds, and can be organised in any way compliant with legal prescriptions. The conditions of the capital increases undertaken under this authorisation, and the rights and obligations attached to the new shares, are determined by the Board of Directors, taking legal prescriptions into account.\n",
      "This authorisation is valid for a period of three years starting from the day of the publication of the authorisation granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders in the Annexes to the Belgian Official Gazette. This authorisation can be extended once or multiple times, each time for a maximum period of five years, by means of a decision of the General Meeting of Shareholders, deliberating according to the guidelines that apply for changes in bylaws. The current authorisation will end in October 2024.\n",
      "Treasury shares\n",
      "Treasury shares are recognised at the cost of the treasury shares purchased. At 31 March 2023, Colruyt Group held 6.687.980 treasury shares; this represents 4,99% of the shares issued at the reporting date. During the financial year, 3.169.026 treasury shares were repurchased for an amount of EUR 94,8 million. We refer to the Corporate Governance section for more details on the purchase of treasury shares.\n",
      "Dividends\n",
      "On 9 June 2023, a gross dividend of EUR 101,6 million or EUR 0,80 per share was proposed by the Board of Directors. In the previous financial year the gross dividend amounted to EUR 139,9 million or EUR 1,10 per share. The gross dividend takes into account the number of treasury shares held on 9 June 2023. The dividend was not incorporated in the consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2022/23.\n",
      "Shareholder structure\n",
      "Based on the most recent transparency notification of 24 March 2023 and taking into account the companies’ treasury shares held by the company at 31 March 2023, the shareholder structure of Etn. Fr. Colruyt NV is as follows:\n",
      "(1) Situation at 31 March 2023.\n",
      "The remainder of the total shares issued (134.077.688 shares at 31 March 2023), i.e. 44.420.368 shares or 33,13%, are publicly held. We refer to the Corporate Governance section for more details.\n",

      "The provision for environmental risks primarily relates to site remediation costs.\n",
      "The other provisions consist mainly of provisions for vacant properties and reinsurance.\n",
      "Colruyt Group offers various types of post-employment benefits. These include retirement benefit plans and other arrangements in respect of post-employment benefits. In accordance with IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’, the post-employment benefits are subdivided into either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.\n",
      "Defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return\n",
      "In Belgium, the Law regarding supplementary pensions (‘WAP’) requires employers to guarantee a minimum return on defined contribution plans over the course of the career. For amounts until 31 December 2015, this minimum return was 3,25% on employer contributions and 3,75% on employee contributions. As a result of a law change in December 2015, the interest rate to be guaranteed is variable starting from 1 January 2016, based on a mechanism linked to the return of the Belgian OLO bond with a minimum of 1,75% and a maximum of 3,75%. Since 2016 the minimum return has been 1,75%. For more details on the actuarial assumption used, we refer to the summary of the main actuarial assumptions used in calculating the liabilities related to the defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return.\n",
      "Owing to these legal changes, and also to the fact that a clear position was taken by the regulatory instances during 2016, and given that reliable estimates can be made for these retirement benefit plans, the Belgian defined contribution plans have been considered as defined benefit plans since financial year 2016/17. They are measured in accordance with IAS 19 based on the ‘projected unit credit’ method.\n",
      "The amount resulting from the group’s liabilities related to its defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return, as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position, is as follows:\n",
      "Experience adjustments also include the effects of wage index adjustments that occurred during the financial year. In financial year 2022/23, these were higher than expected.\n",
      "Plan assets (EUR 204,4 million) are held with a third-party insurance company and consist of reserves accumulated by employer and employee contributions. They consist entirely of insured contracts with guaranteed returns.\n",
      "The evolution of the fair value of the plan assets is as follows:\n",
      "The average term of the liabilities for defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return is 16,03 years vs 16,82 years in the previous year.\n",
      "The amounts relative to these defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return that are recognised in the consolidated income statement and in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income can be summarised as follows:\n",
      "Included under ‘Employee benefit expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.\n",
      "Included under ‘Net financial result’ in the consolidated income statement.\n",
      "The main actuarial assumptions that were used in the calculation of the liabilities related to the defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return can be summarised as follows:\n",
      "discount rate: 3,75% vs 1,85% in previous financial year;\n",
      "price inflation: 2,20% vs 1,80% in previous financial year;\n",
      "salary inflation: 2,70% vs 2,30% in previous financial year.\n",
      "expected future minimum WAP return: 2,80% vs 1,75% in previous financial year.\n",
      "Application of the formula for calculating the WAP return has consistently led to a rate below the minimum rate since 2016. Since January 2022, the 10-year OLO rate has increased from 0,29% to 3,00% at 31 March 2023. Based on OLO rates at longer maturities, the minimum legal yield is estimated at 2,80% at 31 March 2023.\n",
      "Description of the main risks\n",
      "Colruyt Group is exposed by its defined benefit plans to a number of risks, of which the most important ones are explained below:\n",
      "Volatility of plan assets - investment risk\n",
      "The retirement benefit liabilities are calculated using a discount rate determined by prime company returns. In the event the plan assets do not reach this level of return, the defined benefit liabilities on account of Colruyt Group may increase. Colruyt Group reduces the investment risk by investing in insurance contracts instead of equity instruments.\n",
      "Interest risk\n",
      "A decrease in returns will increase the retirement benefit liabilities; however this will be partly compensated by an increase in value of bonds held by the retirement benefit plans.\n",
      "Life expectancy\n",
      "The retirement benefit liabilities mainly concern benefits that are provided to the participant during his or her lifetime. An increase in life expectancy will therefore lead to an increase in retirement benefit liabilities.\n",
      "Salary expectancy\n",
      "The fair value of retirement benefit liabilities is calculated based on the current and estimated future salary of the participants in the retirement benefit plans. As a result, an increase in salary of the participants in the retirement benefit plan will lead to an increase in the retirement benefit liabilities.\n",
      "Benefits related to ‘Unemployment regime with company supplement’\n",
      "Included under ‘Employee benefit expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.\n",
      "Included under ‘Net financial result’ in the consolidated income statement.\n",
      "Included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n",
      "The possibility to retire early, as it exists within Colruyt Group for employees of its Belgian entities, is based on the ‘Unemployment regime with company supplement’ applicable in Belgium. The accounting policies in respect of the liabilities and costs related to this system are included under note 1.5. Other significant accounting policies.\n",
      "Colruyt Group regularly reviews the long-term assumptions in respect of these liabilities. For this financial year the following assumptions were used:\n",
      "discount rate: 3,75% vs 1,80% in previous financial year;\n",
      "salary inflation: 2,70% vs 2,30% in previous financial year.\n",
      "The weighted average duration of the liability for benefits under the ‘Unemployment regime with company supplement’ is 13,86 years, as compared to 15,39 years in the previous year.\n",
      "Other post-employment benefits\n",
      "Included under ‘Employee benefit expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.\n",
      "Included under ‘Net financial result’ in the consolidated income statement.\n",
      "Included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n",
      "Other post-employment benefits payable at retirement consist of long-service benefits (Belgian entities) and legal compensations (French and Indian entities). For the long-service benefits (Belgian entities), Colruyt Group uses the following parameters:\n",
      "discount rate: 3,75% vs 1,80% in previous financial year;\n",
      "salary inflation: 2,70% vs 2,30% in previous financial year.\n",
      "For the legally established benefits, the following parameters are used:\n",
      "French entities:\n",
      "discount rate: 3,75% vs 1,90% in previous financial year;\n",
      "salary inflation: 2,00% (same as previous financial year).\n",
      "Indian entities:\n",
      "discount rate: 7,40% vs 6,90% in previous financial year;\n",
      "salary inflation: 10,00% (same as previous financial year).\n",
      "Changes to the main assumptions impact the group’s main employee benefits-related liabilities as follows:\n",
      "The above are purely hypothetical changes in individual assumptions, keeping all other assumptions unchanged: economic factors and their changes will often impact more than one assumption at a time and the impact of changes in assumptions is not linear. As a result, the information above does not necessarily provide a reasonable reflection of future results.\n",
      "Interest-bearing liabilities\n",
      "Terms and repayment schedule\n",
      "(1) As adjusted due to discontinued operations. See note 16 for more information on liabilities from discontinued operations.\n",
      "Interest-bearing liabilities consist mainly of lease liabilities, bank borrowings and the fixed-rate green retail bond. The increase compared to the previous reporting period is due to withdrawals under short- and long-term financing arrangements as well as the issuance of a green retail bond that was successfully completed in February 2023, raising the maximum amount of EUR 250 million. Repayment of the green retail bond is scheduled for February 2028. Interest coupons worth EUR 10,6 million are due annually.\n",

      "Risks related to financial instruments\n",
      "Currency risk\n",
      "Colruyt Group’s operational entities are mainly located in the euro zone, except for its activities in India, Hong Kong and Africa. The exchange rate risk incurred when consolidating revenues and costs of subsidiaries not reporting in euro is not hedged.\n",
      "In addition, Colruyt Group incurs a transactional currency risk on purchases in foreign currency. Colruyt Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to this type of currency risk, with no speculative purposes.\n",
      "Colruyt Group’s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is based on the following positions in foreign currencies:\n",
      "The net positions per currency are presented before intra-group eliminations. A positive amount implies that entities of Colruyt Group have a net receivable in the first currency. The second currency of the pair is the functional currency of the Colruyt Group entity concerned.\n",
      "The impact of exchange rate changes compared to the euro is relatively limited.\n",
      "Interest rate risk\n",
      "Loans with maturities exceeding one year were always concluded with a fixed interest rate in order to limit interest rate risk.\n",
      "At 31 March 2023 the total amount of bank and other borrowings as well as the fixed-rate green retail bond was EUR 1.018,3 million (long-term and short-term together) (EUR 684,7 million at 31 March 2022) or 16,6% of the balance sheet total and 291% of the net cash and cash equivalents. New long- and sort- term loans were taken out in 2022/23. Given that EUR 410,6 million of the bank and other loans matures within the year, a possible refinancing of these loans will incur higher interest rates, given the sharp rise in interest rates in recent months.\n",
      "Colruyt Group’s lease liabilities total EUR 328,4 million in the current financial year, as against EUR 284,0 million in the previous\n",
      "financial year. The lease liabilities are concluded under IFRS 16 with a fixed interest rate so that a change in the market interest rate cannot impact the future cash flows of Colruyt Group's current lease liabilities, nor the results to be realised.\n",
      "A change in interest rates may have an effect on the consolidated income statement or on future cash flows of Colruyt Group.\n",
      "Credit risk\n",
      "Colruyt Group is subject to credit risk in its operating activities, its liquidity management and, to a limited extent, in other and other financial activities.\n",
      "To limit the credit risk for its liquidity management (term deposits, cash and cash equivalents, and bank guarantees), Colruyt Group\n",
      "ensures that its liquidities and transactions are spread over several financial institutions with good credit ratings. Colruyt Group proactively monitors the stability and associated credit rating of these financial institutions, adjusting its liquidity management strategy where necessary.\n",
      "The credit risk in relation to trade receivables from its operational activities is limited since most of Colruyt Group’s customers pay cash. The main part of Colruyt Group’s receivables is linked with the retail and wholesale activity for which Colruyt Group uses the payment terms customary in the industry. The risks minimised by regularly monitoring the creditworthiness of debtors and limiting outstanding receivables through credit limits. Where necessary, Colruyt Group requests bank guarantees or covers credit risk through credit insurance. The credit risk is spread over a large number of debtors.\n",
      "The credit risk for other current and non-current receivables from its other and other financial activities is low for Colruyt Group due to the limited amount of outstanding amounts. These receivables consist mainly of loans to customers, associates and joint ventures or receivables arising from sublease agreements. The credit risk of the sublease receivables is further reduced by the bank guarantees received and the collateral on the leased building. The credit risk for loans to customers and associates is controlled through regular monitoring of the credit risk on an individual basis. To monitor\n",
      "the credit risk of loans to associates, Colruyt Group can rely on the additional information obtained as a related party.\n",
      "Colruyt Group’s maximum credit risk is represented by defaulting counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the net carrying amount of these assets. For the net carrying amount of the various assets with credit risk, see 27.1.F – Financial assets and liabilities per category and per class. From certain customers, bank guarantees are received or credit insurance policies taken out with a view to securing the collectability of receivables and limiting the\n",
      "real credit risk at the level of trade receivables. However, these bank guarantees or credit insurance policies are not taken into account when assessing the creditworthiness of the parties involved, in line with the provisions under IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’.\n",
      "Colruyt Group considers a financial asset in default when internal or external information indicates that it is unlikely that the outstanding contractual amounts will be received in full, prior to observance of any credit protection.\n",
      "Credit losses are recognised using a model based on ‘expected credit losses’ in line with IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, taking into account the impact of changes in economic factors on expected losses. To calculate expected credit losses, Colruyt Group makes use of the simplified approach based on a provision matrix for trade receivables and of the general approach under which credit losses are determined at the level of the individual receivable. For receivables from associates or joint ventures, an assessment is made as to whether an expected credit loss should be recorded as part of an indication of impairment on the carrying amount of an equity pick-up. See also note 1.5.E – ‘Financial Assets: Expected credit losses’.\n",
      "Liquidity risk\n",
      "Finco NV and Finco France SARL, Colruyt Group’s financial coordinators, ensure that all entities of Colruyt Group have access to the financial resources they need and apply a cash pooling system, i.e. any excess in cash and cash equivalents within entities of the group is used for shortages in other entities of the group. Finco NV and Finco France SARL are also responsible for the investment of Colruyt Group’s cash and cash equivalents. Finco NV and Finco France SARL use cash projections to follow up on Colruyt Group’s liquidity.\n",

As part of this, a committed revolving credit facility for EUR 530 million was concluded with a banking syndicate in September 2022. At 31 March 2023, EUR 150 million had been drawn on this credit facility. Colruyt Group also makes use of several other bilateral lines of credit.

      "decrease is mainly due to the convertible loan to Virya Energy NV (EUR 95,0 million) that was converted into shares in the course of the current financial year. Until the conversion date, this compound instrument was measured at fair value and included in the category ‘Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’. Colruyt Group’s reinsurance company, Locré SA, manages a portfolio of securities (fixed-income securities and shares). This is held to cover the reinsurance risk and includes EUR 26.5 million financial current assets (EUR 25.2 million at 31 March 2022).\n",
      "Fluctuations in market values and other market parameters of these instruments can therefore have an impact on Colruyt Group’s financial result. A total net write-down of EUR -0,7 million (previous reporting period a net upward revaluation of EUR 8,1 million) was recorded for the current financial year, of which a net write-down was realised through the profit or loss of EUR -0,4 million and an unrealised result of EUR -0,3 million.\n",
      "The ratio of the current investment portfolio to net cash and cash equivalents of Colruyt Group amounts to 8,7% (72,9% for the previous reporting period).\n",
      "Financial assets and liabilities per category and per class\n",
      "In accordance with IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’, financial instruments measured at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy.\n",
      "The carrying amounts of non-current bank borrowings and other, and other non-current receivables are not materially different from their fair values.\n",
      "The carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost is estimated to reasonably approximate their fair value due to their short maturity.\n",
      "Fair value disclosures are not required in respect of lease liabilities at amortised cost.\n",
      "The carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are estimated to reasonably approximate their fair value due to their short maturity.\n",
      "The carrying amounts of non-current bank borrowings and other, and other non-current receivables are not materially different from their fair values.\n",
      "Fair value disclosures are not required in respect of lease liabilities at amortised cost.\n",
      "The fair value hierarchy is based on the inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities at measurement date. The following three levels are distinguished:\n",
      "Level 1: inputs used for measurement of fair value are officially quoted (unadjusted) prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\n",
      "Level 2: the fair value of financial instruments not traded on an active market is determined using valuation techniques. These techniques use inputs of observable market prices, if available, as much as possible and avoid reliance on entity-specific estimations.\n",
      "Level 3: financial instruments for which the fair value is determined with valuation techniques using certain parameters not based on observable market data.\n",
      "For the amounts recognised at ‘Amortised cost’ we can conclude that the carrying amount equals the fair value in most cases due to the nature of the instrument or due to the short- term character. Those cases whereby the amortised cost deviates from the fair value are not material.\n",
      "For the amounts measured at fair value we refer to note 14. Financial assets, which describes how the fair value is measured.\n",
      "On 12 June 2020, Colruyt Group subscribed to a first tranche of convertible bonds with a 24-month maturity, issued by the associate Virya Energy NV in an amount of EUR 63,9 million. On 15 January 2021, this amount was increased to EUR 97,4 million with the subscription of a second tranche of convertible bonds with the same maturity date as the first tranche (12 June 2022). In early June 2022, all convertible bonds were converted by Colruyt Group into shares of Virya Energy NV, increasing the stake in Virya Energy NV from 59,78% to 59,94%. Consequently, the carrying amount of the associate Virya Energy NV on Colruyt Group's balance sheet increased by EUR 95,0 million. Until the conversion date, this compound instrument was measured at fair value and included in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’.\n",
      "The financial assets classified under level 3 include, amongst others, the investments in the holding company Sofindev IV NV, in the investment funds Good Harvest Belgium I SRL and Blue Horizon Ventures I SCSp RAIF and in North Sea Wind CV, a cooperative in which Colruyt Group has no significant influence.\n",
      "The opening and closing balance of the investments classified under level 3 can be reconciled as follows:\n",
      "Other risks\n",
      "Financial consequences of the macroeconomic environment\n",
      "Colruyt Group is affected by the macroeconomic consequences of the war in Ukraine and the disrupted supply chain, with (in)direct consequences for the financial statements:\n",
      "High and volatile energy costs impacting normal operating activities and logistics costs, but also increasing revenues from the supply of energy through DATS 24 NV (accounted for using the equity method as of June 2023);\n",
      "Higher revenue and increased labour costs, operating costs and cost of goods sold due to rising inflation;\n",
      "Rising interest rates affecting the discount rates for the impairment test and the non-current liabilities related to employee benefit expenses. In view of the current interest rate environment, there is a risk that short-term loans are refinanced at higher interest rates.\n",
      "Colruyt Group continues to closely monitor and assess the macroeconomic consequences and the operational and supply chain aspects and, where possible, taken appropriate measures to limit the impact of these events and the (in)direct consequences. Colruyt Group examines on a case-by-case basis whether it is appropriate to hedge its exposure to the interest rate risk on existing (or future) loans. This can be done either by taking out longer-term loans with a fixed interest rate or by entering into a financial derivative instrument.\n",
      "Financial impact of the Ukraine war\n",
      "Colruyt Group has no direct operations in Russia or Ukraine. Apart from the financial consequences mentioned above, the conflict has no impact on Colruyt Group's financial statements.\n",
      "Climate\n",
      "When identifying and monitoring the risks impacting on the financial statements, Colruyt Group also takes into account the impact of potential operational risks arising from climate- related events. In the medium term, we assume that there will be no material financial impact on Colruyt Group's activities. There is a reasonable chance of an impact from flooding and heavy rainfall on some of our individual assets. These buildings have been identified and appropriate measures are being taken to minimise the likelihood and impact. For other climate-related events, a recent study involving scenarios until 2050 confirms that the impact would not be material. For those buildings that would have a critical impact on the process across all business operations, the necessary business continuity plans have been developed; these are also tested on a regular basis, thus also limiting the impact on Colruyt Group’s overall business process.\n",
      "Other\n",
      "Colruyt Group is further exposed to various other risks that are not necessarily financial in nature, but nevertheless have the potential to impact Colruyt Group’s financial position. For a description of risks other than the ones mentioned above and of how Colruyt Group manages its exposure to these risks, we refer to the Corporate Governance section. In this respect, we also refer to the Audit Committee, which regularly discusses the risk reports of the Risk Management department (internal audit).\n",
      "Off-balance sheet rights and commitments\n",
      "Colruyt Group has a number of commitments which are not recognised in the statement of financial position. These are mainly contractual obligations related to future acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and future purchases of goods and services.\n",
      "The amounts due in respect of these commitments are as follows:\n",
      "(1) Leases outside the scope of IFRS 16.\n",
      "The off-balance sheet commitments for lease arrangements in a lessee capacity amount to EUR 3,5 million (EUR 3,4 million at 31 March 2022) and relate to short-term leases or leases of low-value assets. In addition, these off-balance sheet commitments also contain arrangements that do not meet the definition of a lease.\n",
      "The income statement includes rental and rental-related charges in respect of movables totalling EUR 24,6 million (EUR 18,5 million for the previous reporting period). These rental charges mainly result from cancellable lease arrangements that do not meet the definition of a lease.\n",
      "The commitments relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment totalling EUR 115,7 million (EUR 108,0 million in the previous reporting period) consist mainly of contractual commitments for the acquisition of land and buildings.\n",
      "The commitments relating to purchases of goods for an amount of EUR 253,6 million (EUR 171,7 million in the previous reporting period) are the result of forward contracts concluded with suppliers in order for Colruyt Group to ensure the sufficient supply of certain trade goods, clothing collections and raw materials for production. This includes purchase commitments related to electricity from discontinued operations (EUR 56,6 million).\n",
      "The line ‘Other commitments’ mainly relates to commitments arising from various non-cancellable forward contracts regarding ICT services (mainly for software maintenance and development) for an amount of EUR 36,6 million (EUR 33,7 million in the previous reporting period).\n",
      "In addition to these commitments Colruyt Group also has certain rights which are not recognised in the statement of financial position. Occasionally Colruyt Group leases out certain immovable assets under lease arrangements.\n",
      "The amounts to be received in relation to these rights are to be classified as follows:\n",
      "The off-balance sheet commitments for lease arrangements amount to EUR 16,0 million (EUR 14,7 million as per 31 March 2022) and mainly relate to operating lease arrangements as lessor in respect of subleased assets.\n",
      "The rights resulting from non-cancellable agreements in respect of movables are not material.\n",
      "Contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n",
      "Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are all those items in relation to third parties which are not recognised in the statement of financial position, in accordance with IAS 37,\n",
      "‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’.\n",
      "The table below gives an overview of all contingent liabilities of Colruyt Group.\n",
      "At the reporting date there were a limited number of legal actions outstanding against Colruyt Group which, although disputed, constitute a contingent liability of EUR 3,8 million (compared to EUR 7,1 million in the previous reporting period). The pending cases primarily concern commercial law claims. As was the case last year, there are no contingent liabilities for pending cases in respect of taxation law, common law or social law.\n",
      "‘Other’ contingent liabilities represent guarantees provided by Colruyt Group towards financial institutions. These guarantees consist of buyback commitments supplied as an additional guarantee for the financing of affiliated independent storekeepers for an amount of EUR 0,1 million (compared to EUR 0,6 million in the previous reporting period).\n",
      "When acquiring interests and determining goodwill, a conditional variable compensation is applied, with the most accurate estimate possible of the amount to be finally calculated at the end of the valuation period.\n",
      "Colruyt Group expects no significant financial disadvantages to be derived from these liabilities. There are no material contingent assets to be reported.\n",
      "Dividends paid and proposed\n",
      "On 4 October 2022 a gross dividend of EUR 1,10 per share was paid to the shareholders.\n",
      "For the financial year 2022/23, the Board of Directors has proposed a gross dividend of EUR 0,80 per share, which will be declared payable from 3 October 2023. As the decision to distribute a dividend is to be considered an event after reporting date which is not to be included in the statement of financial position, this dividend, which is still to be approved at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of 27 September 2023, is therefore not recorded as a liability in the statement of financial position.\n",
      "Taking into account that the distribution proposed by the Board of Directors relates to 126.991.787 shares (after deduction of treasury shares), as determined on 9 June 2023, the total amount of proposed dividends is EUR 101,6 million.\n",
      "Related parties\n",
      "An overview of related party transactions is given below. In this note, only the transactions which were not eliminated in the consolidated financial statements are presented. Colruyt Group identifies, in accordance with IAS 24, ‘Related Party Disclosures’, different categories of related parties:\n",
      "key managers of Colruyt Group and relatives. Key management is formed by the members of the Board of Directors and the Management Committee (see Corporate Governance section);\n",
      "entities that control Colruyt Group: Korys NV controlled by Stichting Administratiekantoor Cozin (see Corporate Governance section);\n",
      "associates (see note 12. Investments in associates);\n",
      "joint ventures (see note 13. Investments in joint ventures); and\n",
      "entities controlled by persons belonging to the key management of Colruyt Group. Last year, Colruyt Group had no material transactions with these entities. There were however transactions with Smartmat NV, now an associate.\n",
      "Related party transactions excluding key management personnel compensation\n",
      "The amounts disclosed above result from transactions made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions between independent parties. Transactions with various related parties generated revenue for an amount of EUR 4,0 million (EUR 9,2 million in the previous reporting period).\n",
      "Colruyt Group and Korys took the requisite measures in the context of the conflict of interest rules. We refer to the Corporate Governance section for more details.\n",
      "The costs arising from transactions with various related parties amount to EUR 21,8 million and mainly relate to the purchase of energy-related products (EUR 14,3 million). Outstanding receivables from related parties decreased from EUR 115,1 million to EUR 8,9 million due to the termination of compound instruments with an associate.\n",
      "Key management personnel compensation\n",
      "The compensation awarded to key management personnel is summarised below. All amounts are gross amounts before taxes. Social security contributions were paid on these amounts.\n",
      "More information regarding the different components of compensation for key management personnel can be found in the remuneration report (see section Corporate Governance) as prepared by the Remuneration Committee.\n",
      "Events after the reporting date\n",
      "During an extraordinary works council held on 19 April 2023, Dreamland and Dreambaby announced their intention to restructure, to which the Procedure Renault applies. Dreamland and Dreambaby together employ about 1.100 employees. The intention to restructure affected 192 employees and also implied the closure of a limited number of stores (1 Dreamland store and 5 Dreambaby stores). The first stage (information and consultation stage) of the Procedure Renault was completed at the end of May. Subsequently, on 26 May 2023, the Board of Directors of Dreamland and Dreambaby decided to proceed with the collective dismissal of 151 employees in total. As a people-oriented employer, Colruyt Group will make maximum efforts to provide professional reorientation within the group to reduce the number of redundancies.\n",
      "In addition, on 19 April 2023, Colruyt Group reached a principle agreement with ToyChamp whereby ToyChamp would obtain 75% of the shares of Dreamland and thus gain control over Dreamland. Dreamland will continue to exist; as a brand, as a legal entity and as an employer. The current management of Dreamland remains on board. The principle agreement was recently developed further and converted into a final agreement. Completion of the transaction is expected in the third quarter of the financial year 2023/24 and will have a limited one-off effect on the net result of the financial year 2023/24 (still highly subject to further developments between the closing of the financial year, i.e. 31 March 2023, and the completion of the transaction).\n",
      "In the current annual report relating to the financial year 2022/23, Dreamland is not presented as a discontinued operation with assets and related liabilities reclassified as held for sale as required by IFRS 5, ‘Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’. As per 31 March 2023 important conditions have not been met, management states that the assets and liabilities to be held for sale are not yet available for immediate sale in their present condition.\n",
      "At closing of the transaction, Dreamland will no longer be fully consolidated in the consolidated figures of Colruyt Group. The group will in that case act in accordance with the applicable regulations and communicate on further developments.\n",
      "On 1 June 2023, Colruyt Group and Virya Energy NV reached an agreement to fully integrate DATS 24 NV into Virya Energy NV. The transaction is based on an enterprise value of EUR 56 million, plus a potential earn-out consideration of up to EUR 11 million. Following this transaction, Colruyt Group’s cash flow statement is expected to include a cash inflow of approximately the same order of magnitude (inter alia after settlement of intragroup positions and net of cash and cash equivalents disposed of, which in total are estimated at\n",
      "approximately EUR 25 million – based on preliminary figures per 31 March 2023). Furthermore, this transaction is expected to result in a limited one-off impact on the net result of the financial year 2023/24. Both are subject to the customary post-closing purchase price adjustments. Additionally, certain assets have been transferred from Colruyt Group for a total of EUR 6 million. Arm’s length principles were applied for the valuation.\n",
      "As of June 2023, DATS 24 will no longer be fully consolidated by Colruyt Group, but by Virya Energy NV. This means that as of June 2023, the results of DATS 24 will be accounted for in Colruyt Group’s consolidated figures via Virya Energy NV using the equity method.\n",
      "The fuel distribution activities in France are inseparably connected to, and therefore an integral part of, the stores in France and are not included in this transaction. The necessary measures have been taken in view of the conflict of interest rules.\n",
      "On 2 February 2023, Colruyt Group reached agreement to acquire 100% of the shares of Degrenne Distribution, owned by the Degrenne family. The acquisition is subject to the suspensive condition of approval by the French Competition Authority as well as by the French Ministry of Economy and Finance under the international investment law.\n",
      "The necessary approvals have been obtained and the transaction has been finalised at the beginning of July 2023. Degrenne Distribution will be fully consolidated in the course of financial year 2023/24. Both parties have agreed not to disclose any details regarding the price or any other terms of the transaction. Arm’s length principles were applied for the valuation. At the date of approval of the annual report, Colruyt Group did not yet have all the information to determine goodwill.\n",
      "After period-end, 397.921 treasury shares were purchased for an amount of EUR 12,2 million. On 9 June 2023, Colruyt Group held 7.085.901 treasury shares, which represented 5,28% of the total number of shares issued.\n",
      "There were no further significant events after the balance sheet date.\n",
      "Independent auditor’s remuneration\n",
      "The table below provides an overview of remuneration paid to the independent auditor and its associated parties for services rendered to Colruyt Group.\n",
      "The consideration paid for audit services was EUR 1,2 million, of which EUR 0,3 million was recognised at the level of the Company and EUR 0,9 million was recognised at the level of its subsidiaries.\n",
      "For non-audit services, such as other audit assignments, tax advice and other assignments, the costs are negligible.\n",

      "Changes in consolidation scope\n",
      "New investments\n",
      "On 30 June 2022, Colruyt Group acquired 100% of the shares of Cycles IMP BV. The acquisition of Cycles IMP BV is part of Bike Republic's expansion within Brussels.\n",
      "In July 2022, Colruyt Group fully acquired FD Company 2 BV. FD Company 2 BV in turn holds 100% of the shares of Heylen-Engels BV. Both companies have, since the acquisition date, been accounted for as subsidiaries and are fully consolidated.\n",
      "On 31 August 2022, Colruyt Group acquired 100% of the shares of Yaleli BV. Yaleli BV operates 2 bicycle stores, one in Aalst and one in Ninove.\n",
      "On 30 November 2022, Colruyt Group acquired 100% of the shares of Oyxgen Clubs BV. Oxygen Clubs BV operates 6 fitness clubs in East Flanders, in locations complementary to the existing Jims network in Flanders. In January 2023, the company's corporate name was changed to Jims Oost BV.\n",
      "On 29 December 2022, Colruyt Group acquired 100% of the shares of Société Agricole de Meester BV (SAM for short). The company owns approximately 373 hectares of agricultural land. This acquisition fits with Colruyt Group's agricultural activities (Agripartners NV).\n",
      "During the financial year, a 25% stake was acquired in the company Pluginvest BV (May 2022). Pluginvest BV offers various charging solutions for businesses and private individuals through an offering of charging stations and associated services with a view to building a long-term relationship in which Pluginvest BV aims to unburden its customers as an integrator. This company is accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method.\n",
      "On 16 March 2023, Colruyt Group acquired 100% of the shares of EW 738/740 BV. The acquisition is part of a redevelopment project in which an Okay Compact and several residential units will be developed.\n",
      "Mergers\n",
      "The companies Eoly NV and DATS 24 NV merged with effect from 1 April 2022.\n",
      "Furthermore, a silent merger took place between the companies Smartmat NV and 15gram BV, with retrospective effect from 2 June 2022.\n",

      "Newly established companies\n",
      "In Belgium, the companies Codevco XIV NV, Codevco XV NV, Codevco XVI NV were established (December 2022).\n",
      "Other changes\n",
      "On 13 September 2022, Colruyt Group increased its stake in Daltix NV from 77,55% to 78,76%. This company is accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method.\n",
      "On 14 October 2022, Colruyt Group increased its stake in Newpharma Group NV from 61% to 100%. Since then, Newpharma Group NV has been an integral part of Colruyt Group, as a result of which the investment in Newpharma Group NV is fully accounted for as a subsidiary, and no longer as an associate company using the equity method. The requisite measures were taken in the context of the conflict of interest rules. At acquisition date, the fair value of the 61% stake in the associate's capital already held was set at EUR 85,7 million, whereby the resulting gain can be considered negligible in relation to the carrying amount of the associate. Consequently, the gain of control over Newpharma Group NV has no impact on the result of the financial year 2022/23.\n",

This also demands that the organisation consciously deploy time and money in all the various projects it wants to carry out.\\nIn addition, the world is becoming increasingly digital and we want to continue to work to evolve with the times and to use digital resources where this can help us and our employees. This is necessary to remain relevant to our customers.\", 'What are our mitigating actions?': 'Colruyt Group continuously attaches importance to data and digitisation skills, for all group employees, both in the business and in our IT and Data & Analytics departments This takes the form of e-learning the basic digital skills that we expect of\\n8.000 of our employees.\\nWe have invested in a major project to make data available faster and more efficiently, which we will now be converting into value.\\nThe organisation is questioned about the strategic needs for data and digitisation.\\nWe continue to canvas our customers about their needs, and remain committed to digital evolution. Phygital is one of the biggest changes in our strategic plan.'}, {'Risk': 'Relevance risk', 'Why is this a risk for us?': \"Our customers are constantly evolving. Colruyt Group wants to constantly stand out from the competition with its brands in order to continue to attract our target group (customers). We do this with our various store formats and our brands (products we offer of which we are the producer/exclusive distributor).\\nOn top of this, consolidation in the food retail industry is likely to continue due to increased competition from larger companies.\\nThe sector in which the group operates is also exposed to changing consumer behaviour. In the event of a significant demographic change and/or if the Group fails to anticipate or identify changes in consumer preferences or trends or to respond to them in a timely manner (e.g. by quickly offering new and improved products), this may result in reduced demand for the group's products and adversely affect our sales.\\nThe current economic and energy crisis is putting further pressure on consumers' purchasing power. This may lead to a decrease in the share of customer spending in the group’s stores. Changing consumer behaviour may also require the Group to adjust its existing product range or add new products in order to maintain or increase sales.\", 'What are our mitigating actions?': 'We continuously focus on both our store formats and our brands. We continue to ask what customers’ expectations are and how we can fulfil them.\\nEvery 2 years, we undertake a detailed analysis of customer needs, behaviour, our reputation,... From this we derive the objectives that we need to apply at customer, store format or brand level so as to remain relevant to our customers.\\nIn this way, Colruyt Group is responding to changing customer needs with innovative digital concepts and services such as Okay Direct, the first self-service store where customers can shop completely autonomously 24/7, as well as the option of home deliveries via Collect&Go in densely populated cities like Brussels and Antwerp.\\nHowever, anticipating consumer trends and preferences requires research, development and marketing initiatives.'}, {'Risk': 'Risks related to market dynamics', 'Why is this a risk for us?': \"An important strategic risk of Colruyt Group relates to trends in consumer spending and cost inflation. Given the group’s aim to guarantee in its Colruyt stores the lowest prices on the market, competitors’ actions and the economic impact of the geopolitical situation can affect the group’s profitability. While Colruyt Group's share of the retail market has remained stable in recent years, this market remains highly competitive.\", 'What are our mitigating actions?': 'With our departments continuously scanning the market and communicating with the management team, the group makes sure that it is aware as quickly as possible of market trends that are ahead of us or are becoming reality. We make sure we anticipate this as well as possible in the various parts of the organisation. Colruyt Group is therefore constantly looking to implement efficiency improvements and, where necessary, to question its cost structure.'}]}\n",

      "2022/23 was an eventful, challenging financial year, in which we have continued to evolve, based on our belief that we create added value for society today, tomorrow and in the long term. Over the past thirty years, Colruyt Group has evolved from a family business to a large, diverse group of companies. After years of double-digit growth, we are now experiencing a period of slowdown. This is not uncommon, especially in a context of high inflation that is seriously challenging all retailers and has sharply increased our costs, among other things for energy and employee pay. In retrospect, we are proud that, despite all this, we achieved good revenue growth and consolidated our market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuing to consolidate our long-term strategy required us to take a number of difficult decisions, which after careful consideration of various scenarios proved to be unavoidable.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thus, we published our decision for Dreamland to structurally join forces with Belgian toy specialist ToyChamp in April. In addition, we announced our intention to restructure Dreamland and Dreambaby, applying the ‘Renault Act’ collective redundancy scheme to a number of employees, and closing one Dreamland and five Dreambaby stores. We are convinced that these actions can contribute to the continued existence of Dreamland (now together with ToyChamp) and to that of Dreambaby as an integral part of the group. We are working towards this together, in constructive consultation with our trade union partners. We are and remain incredibly grateful and proud of the people who give the best of themselves for these attractive brands in our non-food area.\n",

      "\n",
      "controlling their operational costs and specifically on energy efficiency. Energy prices started falling again from the beginning of 2023, while the joint market share of Colruyt Lowest Prices, Okay and Spar in Belgium increased to 31,0% at the end of the financial year. Partly as a result of this, we were able to slightly adjust in a positive direction our outlook for the full-year results. Ultimately, our revenue for the financial year increased by 7,7%, to over 10,8 billion euros. The net result decreased by one percentage point to 1,9% of revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the coming financial year, we will maintain our increased focus on efficiency and continue to implement our strategic plan.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and health, in particular, we have taken major steps through investments, participations and acquisitions. Our Jims fitness chain boosted its muscle by acquiring six high-quality clubs from the Oxygen chain. We also took a shareholding in digital health platform yoboo, strong in personal counselling towards healthier lifestyles. Finally, our Newpharma online pharmacy expanded its storage space to over 20.000 m², with potential for future growth. At the beginning of 2023, we concluded an agreement in principle to acquire 100% of the Degrenne Distribution group, a significant regional player in the French convenience store market. The company perfectly complements our Codifrance wholesale branch and will significantly strengthen our presence in France. Our retail network also continued to grow in Belgium and Luxembourg, with 13 new food stores and 22 renovations, representing 13.400 m² of additional retail space.\n",

      "We have also set a new course in the energy field. Our energy holding company Virya Energy reached an agreement to sell its offshore wind energy platform Parkwind to Japanese energy group JERA Green. The takeover offers Parkwind the potential to develop further as a leading international energy player, based in our country. This was a necessary step in an increasingly competitive offshore industry with substantially larger projects and higher investment risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of June 2023, we completed the sale of fuel specialist DATS 24 to Virya Energy. In a rapidly greening energy market, the holding company will gain a lot of clout from this pooling of expertise. For our customers, nothing changes: DATS 24 remains part of the Xtra ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past financial year, we again worked hard on numerous innovation and sustainability initiatives. These include new technologies to speed up checkout flow, while making work more ergonomic for our employees. We have experimented with unmanned vehicles for home delivery from Collect&Go and further digitised our processes and systems.\n",

      "We expect a first harvest of Belgian mussels from our sea farm in summer 2023, for sale in our Cru markets.

The customers of the affiliated stores visited more frequently, taking away smaller average shopping baskets.

Total sales volume decreased slightly, also in line with the contraction in the market.\n",

      "The customer count remained more or less stable, while the volume per refuelling dropped slightly.

      "\n",
      "In Belgian law, there is still considerable uncertainty as to the legal validity and enforceability of a right of recovery, in favour of the company, of variable remuneration.

      "In line with previous years, non-executive directors at Colruyt Group did not receive any share-based remuneration.

      "\n",
      "RISK CULTURE\n",
      "\n",
      "Colruyt Group applies an integrated risk management approach based on the ‘three lines of defence model’. This model determines how specific responsibilities can be assigned within the organisation to achieve Colruyt Group’s objectives and manage the associated risks. This approach contributes\n",
      "\n",
      "to strengthening the risk culture, taking responsibility for the management of risk and internal control, and further optimising and integrating independent control functions (risk management compliance, internal audit).\n",
      "\n",
      "First line - ownership and management of risks and their control: The company itself is responsible for all the risks emanating from its own processes and must ensure their identification and effective controls. In this area, the company ensures\n",
      "\n",
      "that proper controls are in place, that the company’s self- assessment is of sufficient quality, that adequate risk awareness exists, and that sufficient resources are assigned to risk issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk management is an integral part of the Group’s operations. It ranges from day-to-day financial and operational management - including the four-eye principle -, the analysis of new investment cases to the formulation of strategy and objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk management is thus the responsibility of all levels of the organisation, with different responsibilities at each level.\n",

      "\n",
      "Risk management is thus the responsibility of all levels of the organisation, with different responsibilities at each level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second line - continuous monitoring of risks and their control: These functions provide support to the business and management by applying expertise and making independent judgements of the risks faced by Colruyt Group. These functions provide assurance that the business itself (through first-line management) is in control of its risks. Naturally, primary responsibility still lies with the first line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third line - provision of an independent audit system:\n",
      "\n",
      "Internal Audit can be understood as an independent assessment function embedded in the organisation and tasked with investigating and evaluating the proper functioning, effectiveness and efficiency of Colruyt Group’s processes, procedures and activities. This may cover areas such as operating processes, financial transactions and compliance with applicable accounting and other regulations and management. Through this independent review, Internal Audit provides assurance to the Audit Committee on the operational effectiveness of the first- and second-line risk management and internal control processes. In addition, the risk management function is evaluated once a year by an independent consultant, with the results presented to the Board of Directors.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire group is divided into Operating Units (OUs). Each operating unit must go through the following process steps in a structured manner. This process is also performed at Colruyt Group level.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",

      "Risk identification\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk identification is done on a regular basis in preparation for OUs’ new strategic plans. The evolution of the risks already identified and any new risks arising internally or as a result\n",
      "\n",
      "of changes in the outside world are reviewed on an annual basis. Every major incident is also analysed with a focus on its possible recurrence and then included or not as a risk in the risk log.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "After each risk identification, the risks are assessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This assessment involves mapping out the causes and consequences of a risk. Taking into account the effectiveness of the control measures introduced, the risks are scaled according to likelihood and impact. The impact scale is based on the\n",
      "\n",
      "risk appetite established in consultation with the respective operating unit and with the Board of Directors for the group. In order to assess the scale of the impact, four impact criteria are used: economic impact, reputational impact, and the impact on the health and safety of both consumers and employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reputation is interpreted here very broadly as the response of all possible stakeholders, whether consumers, employees,\n",

      "\n",
      "by 2050, making the EU climate-neutral. To achieve its targets, the European Commission foresees redirecting capital flows toward sustainable economic activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU Taxonomy is a classification system to determine whether an economic activity can be considered sustainable. In addition, the regulation also includes a financial reporting requirement for listed companies (cf. NFRD).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a ‘social taxonomy’ is set to follow, the term currently used is a ‘green taxonomy’. The EU Taxonomy Regulation currently defines six environmental objectives to which economic activities should contribute:\n",

      "Climate change mitigation\n",

      "Climate change adaptation\n",

      "\n",
      "Pollution prevention and control\n",
      "\n",
      "For reporting year 2022/23, companies are asked to identify which of their economic activities are potentially environmentally sustainable (‘eligible activities for the taxonomy’) with regard to the first two environmental objectives: climate change mitigation and adaptation – since only these two objectives have as yet been fully developed by the European Commission.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This year we also reviewed these eligible activities against the technical screening criteria and minimum social safeguards defined in the EU Taxonomy. In so doing, we identified the activities that are effectively environmentally sustainable according to the EU Taxonomy (‘aligned activities with the taxonomy’).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (‘Delegated Regulation’) requires companies to report the share of net turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) related to these eligible and aligned economic activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU Taxonomy is new and quite complex. As this legislation is still under development, we are closely monitoring evolutions and organising ourselves as best as possible to comply with the new reporting requirement. In assessing our economic activities, we deliberately opted for a conservative approach.\n",

For example, together with Korys, we are investing in the energy holding company Virya Energy whose main activity is the production of renewable energy and hydrogen.

      "As described in the policies, goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment at the level of the cash-generating unit (CGU) in line with the provisions in IAS 36. Colruyt Group considers the business segments or business entities as CGUs. The impairment test of goodwill consists of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill, with an impairment recognised if the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount. Recoverable amounts are based on value in use. The latter is equal to the present value of the forecast cash flows of each CGU or group of CGUs and is determined using the following data:\n",
      "\n",
      "cash flows based on the latest forecasts, including detailed planning for revenue, EBITDA and investment planning through capital expenditure or leasing. When preparing cash flow forecasts, Colruyt Group uses estimated growth rates and expected future margins derived from the actual figures of the most recent financial year and from forecasts;\n",
      "\n",

      "discounting of expected cash flows at a rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) formula. To determine the discount rate, Colruyt Group uses the ‘Capital Asset Pricing Model’. For its impairment testing, Colruyt Group uses a minimum WACC of 8,0% or, if higher, a WACC calculated on the basis of the 'Capital Asset Pricing Model’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the importance of these assumptions for calculating value in use, a) they are monitored closely at a central level through alignment and validation processes, and b) external sources of information are used to determine them. The principal assumptions for calculating value in use for the CGUs with material goodwill are shown in the following table:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given all CGUs are active in retail activities in Belgium, the same WACC was calculated for all CGUs based on the ‘Capital Asset Pricing Model’. The WACC has risen to a range of 6,3% to 6,7% (versus 5,0% to 6,3% last year) as a result of an increasing risk-free rate partially offset by a decreasing Equity to Capital ratio for Colruyt Group. We also see a limited WACC increase for the peer group as a result of the decline in the beta.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In determining the long-term growth rate, Colruyt Group takes into account internal sources of information, the evolution and expectations of the Belgian retail market and long-term inflation. In line with last year, the long-term growth rate for all CGUs was retained at 1%, with Colruyt Group expecting long-term growth to normalise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impairment tests were performed in February 2023. For Newpharma Group NV, the purchase price allocation of the business combination has not yet been finalised on the reporting date. We therefore only include the provisional goodwill. Newpharma Group NV is currently being integrated into Colruyt Group's operations. At the time of impairment testing, no forecasts existed for the integrated CGU. A value in use was calculated based on a WACC of 8,0% and a long-term growth rate of 2,0% (based on external information and internal expectations for e-commerce and the relevant sector). Based on these tests and the sensitivity analysis, no impairment risk was identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the impairment tests performed, no impairments were identified and there was sufficient headroom for all CGUs, with a minimum headroom in relation to the carrying amount of 32,1%. Colruyt Group is of the opinion that the above-described assumptions used for calculating the value in use provide the best estimation of future evolutions.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Colruyt Group's models also include sensitivity analyses for gross margins, sales growth, increased operating costs, long-term growth rate, WACC and a combination of various parameters. Based on these sensitivity analyses, no impairment risk was identified for the various CGUs and consequently these sensitivity analyses indicate that a reasonably possible change in these assumptions would not result in an impairment.\n",

In this area, the company ensures\\n\\nthat proper controls are in place, that the company’s self- assessment is of sufficient quality, that adequate risk awareness exists, and that sufficient resources are assigned to risk issues.\\n\\nRisk management is an integral part of the Group’s operations.
