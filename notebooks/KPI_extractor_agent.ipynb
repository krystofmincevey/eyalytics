      "GREAT BRANDS, BOLD EXPERIMENTATION\n",
      "As a total beverage company, we are committed to offering people more of the drinks they want across a range of categories and in a variety of sizes. In 2022, we launched\n",
      "246 low- or no-sugar beverages and continued to see double- digit growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which is now available in more than 170 markets. This helped to drive our volume of low- and no-calorie beverage sales to 29% of total volume.\n",
      "We’re driving the most significant marketing transformation in our history, focused on digital-first engagement with\n",
      "consumers. We’re combining partnerships, technology and our consumers’ passions to create unforgettable experiences in music, gaming and sports, including:\n",
      "Coca-Cola Creations: This global innovation platform lends the iconic Coca-Cola brand to new expressions, driven by collaboration, creativity and cultural connection. Launched in 2022, we introduced five limited-edition drinks that drew inspiration from music, gaming and culture. These were complemented with experimental packaging designs and various digital experiences.\n",
      "Sprite Limelight: A music and cultural extension of the brand’s global platform “Heat Happens,” Sprite Limelight aims to unite fans from different cultures and lifestyles by bringing together different artists from around the world.\n",
      "We’re also experimenting with new drinks. We’ve launched Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola as a ready-to-drink cocktail through a relationship with Brown-Forman. This is one example of\n",
      "our ongoing journey to bring Coke to consumers in new and dynamic ways. We take the new responsibilities that come with our entry in this space very seriously. As a result, we’ve embedded our Global Policy on Alcohol Responsibility into our business processes to ensure we grow our alcohol brands in a responsible and sustainable way.\n",
      "SUSTAINABILITY IS CORE TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY\n",
      "Water: Water is a priority for our company because it is the first ingredient in all our beverages and is essential to the communities we serve. As a local business operating in more than 200 countries and territories, we have a responsibility to help protect critical resources.\n",
      "Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security. We work with partners to provide access to a\n",
      "steady supply of clean water for people and ecosystems in the areas where we operate and source ingredients. We recently announced a more focused effort to prioritize the most water- stressed regions. As we’ve done since 2015, we’ll continue to replenish the water we use in our finished beverages to nature and communities. In 2022, we replenished 159%.\n",
      "Our strategy is clear. It’s centered around people—our consumers and employees—and driving sustainable solutions that build resilience into our business to respond\n",

      "Packaging: We seek to drive a circular economy for our packaging because this helps to reduce waste and carbon emissions. We’re working to use more recycled content in our packaging, to expand our use of refillable bottles, and to collect packaging for recycling through our World Without Waste initiative. We also partner to design new solutions for\n",
      "packaging. For example, we licensed our technology for a 100% plant-based plastic bottle to a company building a commercial- scale facility in Germany. This bio-based plastic packaging\n",
      "has a lower carbon footprint than other plastics. While we’re making progress, we know there is more work to be done. In 2022, we collected 61% of the equivalent bottles and cans that we introduced into the market and used 15% rPET\n",
      "in our bottles.\n",
      "To galvanize collective action, we invest in solutions and partnerships across industry, governments and society.\n",
      "In 2022, we became a Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. This group includes companies within key industry sectors that can help drive the transition to a circular economy.\n",
      "Climate: Our water, packaging and climate goals are interconnected. For example, by creating a circular economy for packaging, we can lower our carbon footprint.\n",
      "By approaching water stewardship from a basin perspective, we participate in initiatives that increase communities’ resilience to extreme weather events, alongside our partners.\n",
      "Our approach to climate is rooted in science, and we’ve set a science-based target to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline.\n",
      "As of 2022, we have reduced our emissions by 7% against this baseline.\n",
      "A COMPANY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS\n",
      "We’re committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging and to driving meaningful change in our communities. By 2030, we aspire to be 50% led by women globally. Today, 39% of our senior leaders are women.\n",
      "The Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of\n",
      "The Coca-Cola Company, contributed $94.8 million to 301 organizations around the world in 2022 to help create a better shared future for the communities our business serves.\n",

The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually. Replenish benefits fall under three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL).

      "In 2021, we set a goal to reduce our use of virgin plastic derived from nonrenewable sources by avoiding a cumulative 3 million metric tons by 2025 compared to 2020. We are pursuing this goal, which represents about 20% of our virgin plastic use, through more than 150 lightweighting projects and advancements on use of recycled and renewable materials.\n",
      "In 2022, we avoided around half a million metric tons of virgin plastic usage through these efforts with an incremental avoidance of over 50,000 metric tons since last year. However, growth of plastic packaging has outpaced efforts on lightweighting and use of recycled content, so that we have not reduced our use of virgin plastic overall.\n",
      "Demand for recycled PET plastic for food-grade applications currently exceeds supply, so we need to help build a sustainable pipeline of high-quality material. We work with communities to boost PET recycling and collection; collaborate with recycling partners; and secure rPET to help ensure material for our bottles is used again and again.\n",
      "In recent years, system partners and suppliers have announced significant investments, both individually and through joint ventures, to boost the global rPET infrastructure. Many investments are coming online in the next two years and will change the rPET landscape, particularly in Asia.\n",

      "We work with partners across business, government and civil society to create or support closed-loop systems that ensure our packages are collected and recycled or reused. Delivering a circular economy will require significant and urgent improvement in waste management and recycling systems around the world. Preserving the inherent economic value of our packaging—and ensuring circularity— requires robust collection and recycling systems across packaging types.\n",
      "Collection challenges vary, as every country has unique governments, regulatory environments and consumer behaviors. Though some countries have high recycling rates across packaging types,\n",
      "in many regions the recycling rate for PET bottles lags that of some other materials. While we continue to focus on national collection rates, in 2022, with input from key external stakeholders, we updated our collection tracking guidance to account for material collected through system- led efforts. Company and bottler teams in markets with limited recycling infrastructures (including parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia) are financing system-led collection initiatives to supplement national systems and are launching our own tracking systems. In 2023, we will start incorporating Coca-Cola system-led collection data into our aggregate numbers.\n",

Ultimately, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors oversees climate-related risks.\n",
      "The involvement of our bottling partners and suppliers is essential to achieving our science- based target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030. The following are examples of how we are working on climate initiatives with partners across our value chain.\n",
      "INCREASING RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) IN MANUFACTURING\n",
      "One critical strategy for reducing emissions in our system is the increased use of renewable energy in our manufacturing processes.\n",
      "Renewable electricity usage, which was third- party assured for the first time in 2021, increased from 12% in 2021 to 21% in 2022.\n",
      "To build knowledge across our system and increase the generation, procurement and accurate reporting of renewable energy, we published a Renewable Energy Implementation Guidebook in March 2022. This guidebook provides a step-by-step process for associates across the system to implement on-site solar photovoltaic and solar hot water and steam systems, on-site and off-site renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), coupled with energy attribute certificates to align with GHG Protocol Scope 2 quality criteria.\n",
      "In addition to the guidebook, we launched a future-facing initiative called the Renewable Energy Project Pipeline in 2022, where we work closely with bottling partners to increase the number of renewable energy projects throughout our system. Approximately 20 bottling partners and 13 concentrate plants have developed 2023–2025 renewable energy plans. As the number and scope of these projects expands, we will look for opportunities to collaborate\n",
      "and share best practices.\n",
      "BOTTLING PARTNERS SET SCIENCE-BASED EMISSIONS TARGETS\n",
      "Given the size of our network of bottling partners, they are critically important in making progress toward our climate ambitions. Our bottling partners have a major influence on emissions reductions based on what they buy, make and deliver for our shared customers\n",
      "and consumers.\n",
      "In September 2022, Arca Continental committed to setting a science-based target. This adds to the growing list of our bottlers with approved emissions reductions goals through the Science- Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This list includes Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (CCHBC), Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), AB Inbev, Swire Coca-Cola Limited and Coca-Cola FEMSA.\n",
      "We will be working to grow this list in 2023.\n",
      "ENGAGING WITH SUPPLIERS TO TAKE ACTION ON CLIMATE\n",
      "We continue to find new ways to collaborate and support our suppliers to collectively reduce emissions.\n",
      "In 2022, we joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LoCT) initiative, led by Guidehouse along with 18 other companies to mobilize collective climate action by providing suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to accelerate their decarbonization. As of the end of 2022, there were 94 suppliers to the Coca-Cola system participating in the initiative. The company is directly sponsoring 56 of these suppliers. The program is showing signs of success—10 suppliers that we sponsored, who successfully completed the program, have since set or committed to setting their own SBTi- approved emissions targets.\n",
      "Thanks to The Coca-Cola Company, in April 2022 we had the great opportunity to join the Supplier LoCT initiative. This program helped us to improve the way we calculate our Scope 1 & 2\n",

      "NICOLAS LOOTENS\n",
      "Group Sustainability Manager, Vetropak\n",
      "In total, more than 160 of our suppliers have set or committed to setting SBTi-approved emissions targets.\n",
      "Reducing Emissions from Coolers\n",
      "Coolers have long been a key opportunity because approximately one-third of our emissions comes from cold-drink equipment and dispensing. In early 2023, building on analysis we conducted in 2022, we published internal guidance for coolers used across our value chain. The guidance sets specific energy usage limits, which will require increasing energy efficiency between now and 2030 and help drive the replacement of older, less efficient coolers.\n",
      "We are also installing more “intelligent connected” coolers that can transmit data such as product throughput, maintenance status, temperature and energy use, which has operational benefits in addition to helping reduce emissions.\n",
      "In 2022, 88% of all new coolers placed were HFC-free. This is an increase from 61% of coolers placed in 2016.\n",
      "WHAT’S NEXT?\n",
      "IMPROVING DATA SCOPE AND ACCURACY\n",
      "Gathering complete and accurate data is critical to identifying a path to achieving our science- based target. We are continuously improving the scope and detail of our data collection to ensure all significant sources of emissions across our value chain are included in our inventory. We are updating our 2015 baseline data due to recent acquisitions. Improving our data helps us prioritize projects and programs with the greatest impact, including more detail on renewable energy usage and more data from suppliers.\n",
      "Validate Renewable Energy Claims\n",
      "One area of focus has been to validate the accuracy and completeness of our renewable energy claims. We have done this through assuring our claims to the GHG Protocol. This work began in 2021 and continued through 2022.\n",
      "Suppliers Disclose Data and Targets\n",
      "Because approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from goods and services we buy, it is essential to engage with suppliers to accurately capture our full scope 3 emissions and ensure our suppliers join our decarbonization journey. Each year, we encourage key suppliers to complete CDP’s Supply Chain Climate Change questionnaire, which provides useful data on GHG emissions in our supply chain and information on supplier targets and initiatives to\n",
      "reduce emissions. In 2022, 378 suppliers provided climate data to CDP out of 495 requested,\n",
      "a 12% increase from 2021.\n",
      "Additionally, we are working to improve data accuracy in partnership with several major suppliers across ingredients and packaging, starting with sugar and aluminum, in order to develop supplier-specific emissions factors for the commodities we procure. This allows us to better\n",
      "understand our supply chain, drive change and more accurately track emissions reductions of specific suppliers and commodities in key areas.\n",
      "Even deeper in our supply chain, work is underway to map and understand how land, water use and farming practices in our major agricultural sourcing regions both generate emissions and have the potential to reduce emissions. Costa began its own work in 2022, launching a Climate Smart coffee project in partnership with the Rainforest Alliance. Phase 1 of the project has been to conduct a GHG\n",

      "In addition, we are including our priority sourcing regions as part of our water replenishment programs. For example, in 2022, in partnership with Doktar, an agri-tech company, and with funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation, we launched a project in the regions of Bursa and Tekirdağ in Türkiye, which are priority sourcing regions for apples. The project aims to improve irrigation efficiency and agricultural practices on approximately 500 acres of land growing apples, peaches, nectarines and tomatoes, which are major water users. Sensors will be installed to monitor climate and soil moisture conditions and satellite data (Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) will be used to calculate levels of evapotranspiration. All of this data will be combined to provide personalized irrigation programs for participating farmers and help to avoid excessive watering.\n",

The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually. Replenish benefits fall under three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities in 2019–2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume. Approximately 13.5 BL (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not been able to monitor projects on intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war.\n",
