The net result decreased by one \\npercentage point to 1,9% of revenue. \\nIn the coming financial year, we will maintain our increased focus \\non efficiency and continue to implement our strategic plan. \\nWe are convinced that we will emerge stronger from the current \\nperiod. We therefore continue to expand our smart ecosystem, \\nwith products and services in four areas, where a significant \\nportion of family budgets is spent. In the fields of nutrition \\nand health, in particular, we have taken major steps through \\ninvestments, participations and acquisitions. Our Jims fitness \\nchain boosted its muscle by acquiring six high-quality clubs from \\nthe Oxygen chain. We also took a shareholding in digital health \\nplatform yoboo, strong in personal counselling towards healthier \\nlifestyles. Finally, our Newpharma online pharmacy expanded its \\nstorage space to over 20.000 m², with potential for future growth. \\nAt the beginning of 2023, we concluded an agreement in principle \\nto acquire 100% of the Degrenne Distribution group, a significant \\nregional player in the French convenience store market. The \\ncompany perfectly complements our Codifrance wholesale branch \\nand will significantly strengthen our presence in France.
