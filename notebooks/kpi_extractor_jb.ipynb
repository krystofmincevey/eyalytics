These respond to the most important \\nsustainability challenges facing us and the material \\nsustainability topics. To efficiently achieve these objectives, \\nwe classify them according to our three drivers: product, \\ninfrastructure and people.\\nThe environment and society are the common \\nthread running through our objectives:\\n•  In the ecological area, we intend to reduce our \\nenvironmental footprint as much as possible and \\npromote the circularity of raw materials, materials and \\nproducts. Our products are responsible for 95% of our \\nenvironmental impact. So we can make a big difference \\nhere.\\n•  In the social area, we want to make a positive contribution \\nby focusing on safeguarding human rights in the chain, \\nactively promoting balanced and sustainable lifestyles and \\nsupporting target groups in a vulnerable context.\\nWe consciously set objectives for the entire supply chain: \\nfrom the sourcing of raw materials, through our own \\nretail activities, to our customers. We hope that our new \\nobjectives will also inspire others and are convinced that \\ncollaboration is the key to creating a lasting positive impact.\\nTo concretely realise our seven overarching objectives, \\nwe have formulated 27 sub-objectives. At the time of \\npublication of this annual report, these (sub-)objectives are \\nstill new. Because we want to be transparent, we already \\nshare them here. We have already incorporated a number \\nof them into our sustainability reporting. From next year, \\nwe will integrate all (sub-)objectives in our reporting and \\ncommunicate clearly about our progress.\\n22', metadata={'source': './data/colruyt_annualreport.pdf', 'page': 21})"

       " Document(page_content='Restatement of base year figures\\nA significant part of emissions from natural gas consumption for 2021 was based on calculations. This has since been \\ncorrected in the historical data based on the actual invoices. Some errors in the fuel consumption of the company cars have \\nalso been rectified. In 2022, Roelandt Group and Newpharma were fully included in the consolidation scope. For the entities \\nthat were added to Colruyt Group throughout the reported year, the emissions of a complete year were considered. A few \\nemission factors were updated. The data for base year 2021 has been recalculated to reflect these changes. For scope 3 also,  \\na number of methodological improvements (mainly for the calculation of the product portfolio) led to a recalculation and \\nthus a slightly adjusted base year. The threshold for recalculation is 5%.\\nMethodology\\nWe report our scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions data based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Standard.  \\nCO2 emission data are in the form of a calculated CO2 equivalent, defined as actual CO2 emitted plus equivalent emissions of \\nother relevant GHGs defined by the GHG Protocol.\\nEmission factors\\nThe emission factors used in our calculation are applied in a hierarchical manner. This means that when looking for an \\nemission factor we first consult the ADEME database (version Base Carbone 22.0). We source location-based electricity \\nemission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2022 edition; 2020 data) and GWP values of refrigerants from \\nthe Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Assessment Report (2021). For numbers relating to production processes, \\nwe use primarily ECO Invent. For emission factors not found in any of the above we use DEFRA. For the impact of our product \\nportfolio, we mainly use Agribalyse (through Simapro). The databases used in this exercise are updated regularly. We are \\nworking towards integrating more primary supplier data to increase the quality of our data.\\nOrganisational boundaries\\nTo identify the entities and activities of Colruyt Group included in the scopes, we have applied the ‘Financial Control’ principle. \\nThis principle states that operations that are fully consolidated in the financial accounts should be included in the scopes. \\nEmissions from non-consolidated joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for in the ‘Financial investments’ \\ncategory in scope 3.\\nSUSTAINABILITY  |  SDG 2 • SDG 3 • SDG 6 • SDG 7 • SDG 8 • SDG 12 • SDG 13 • Sustainability indicators • EU TaxonomySDG 13 (continuation)\\n190', metadata={'page': 189.0, 'source': './data/colruyt_annualreport.pdf'}),\n",
