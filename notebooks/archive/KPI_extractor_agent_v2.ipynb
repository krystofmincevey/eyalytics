We are pursuing this goal, which represents about 20% of our virgin plastic use, through more than 150 lightweighting projects and advancements on use of recycled and renewable materials.\n",
      "In 2022, we avoided around half a million metric tons of virgin plastic usage through these efforts with an incremental avoidance of over 50,000 metric tons since last year. However, growth of plastic packaging has outpaced efforts on lightweighting and use of recycled content, so that we have not reduced our use of virgin plastic overall.\n",
      "Demand for recycled PET plastic for food-grade applications currently exceeds supply, so we need to help build a sustainable pipeline of high-quality material. We work with communities to boost PET recycling and collection; collaborate with recycling partners; and secure rPET to help ensure material for our bottles is used again and again.\n",
      "In recent years, system partners and suppliers have announced significant investments, both individually and through joint ventures, to boost the global rPET infrastructure. Many investments are coming online in the next two years and will change the rPET landscape, particularly in Asia.\n",
      "We continue to work with industry peers to advocate for government regulations permitting the use of rPET in food and beverage packaging. Notable countries with food-grade recycled plastics acceptance standards for use in\n",

      "Around the world, many of our biggest brands are taking major steps to support a circular economy for plastic packaging. More than 40 markets currently offer at least one brand in 100% rPET packaging. A few highlights from 2022 include:\n",
      "In the United States and Canada, we recently began offering the majority of DASANI bottles— from 20-oz. and 1.5-liter singles to 10-oz. and\n",
      "12-oz. multipacks—in 100% rPET plastic. The shift supports the DASANI brand's pledge to remove the equivalent of 2 billion virgin plastic bottles from production by 2027 compared to 2021 levels. The announcement followed the launch of 100% rPET bottles in New York, California\n",
      "and Texas, which also included Coca-Cola 20- oz. bottles. Bold, on-pack labels drive consumer awareness with “100% Recycled Bottle” and “Recycle Me Again” calls to action.\n",
      "Eight markets in Europe (Austria, Belgium, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland) offer their entire locally produced portfolios in 100% rPET.\n",
      "In Qatar, Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Arwa water were sold in 100% rPET bottles in FIFA World\n",
      "Cup 2022 stadiums and fan zones. This marked both the FIFA World Cup debut of the sustainable packaging format and the Middle East’s first 100% rPET rollout. Dedicated recycling bins and on-site communication ensured proper collection of all bottles to be recycled and converted locally back into new ones, closing the loop and leaving behind a green legacy.\n",
      "Sustainable Innovation\n",
      "In Vietnam, we launched 100% rPET Coca-Cola bottles, which is projected to avoid 2,000 metric tons of virgin plastic usage annually.\n",

      "SPRITE TRANSITIONS FROM GREEN TO CLEAR PET\n",
      "We continued to transition Sprite plastic bottles from green to clear PET to help increase the efficiency of recycling systems. The move, which the brand has completed or is in process in over 100 countries, improves the efficiency of recycling systems and boosts availability of food-grade rPET. As one example, Coca-Cola North America’s entire green plastic portfolio—including packaging for Sprite, Fresca, Seagram’s and Mello Yello— made the transition to clear PET in 2022.\n",
      "We continue to deliver breakthrough technologies to lightweight our plastic packaging:\n",
      "As The Coca-Cola Company’s second-largest brand, Sprite is proud to demonstrate its commitment to circularity through our packaging by ensuring every bottle we make can be recycled and made into a new one. We can\n",

      "WORLD WITHOUT WASTE: COLLECT\n",
      "1 The collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCS’s sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year.\n",
      "We work with partners across business, government and civil society to create or support closed-loop systems that ensure our packages are collected and recycled or reused. Delivering a circular economy will require significant and urgent improvement in waste management and recycling systems around the world. Preserving the inherent economic value of our packaging—and ensuring circularity— requires robust collection and recycling systems across packaging types.\n",
      "Collection challenges vary, as every country has unique governments, regulatory environments and consumer behaviors. Though some countries have high recycling rates across packaging types,\n",
      "in many regions the recycling rate for PET bottles lags that of some other materials. While we continue to focus on national collection rates, in 2022, with input from key external stakeholders, we updated our collection tracking guidance to account for material collected through system- led efforts. Company and bottler teams in markets with limited recycling infrastructures (including parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia) are financing system-led collection initiatives to supplement national systems and are launching our own tracking systems. In 2023, we will start incorporating Coca-Cola system-led collection data into our aggregate numbers.\n",
      "In emerging markets, we advocate for government regulations permitting the use of rPET in food and beverage packaging, and\n",

      "We also work with peers and partners to advocate for legislation that enables a circular economy, like a recent EPR law passed in Colorado and minimum recycled content laws passed in California, Washington and New Jersey. However, collection rates in the United States trail those of many other countries, and we know there is much more work to do.\n",
      "Ensuring respect for the human rights of vulnerable workers in the informal waste sector is an important pillar of our Collection efforts. Over the last two years, we have partnered with industry peers and Tearfund, an NGO advocating for improved livelihoods for informal waste sector workers, on the   to develop human rights principles and guidelines for engaging with the informal waste collection industry.

These workers have access to training, tools and equipment for efficient waste collection and connections to materials\n",
      "recovery facilities (MRF) that buy the waste that is collected. We also are creating more than 2,000 collection hubs in sari-sari (convenience) stores and other retail outlets where community members can drop off used, clear PET bottles\n",
      "in return for incentives. Participating retailers earn income from selling collected PET bottles to waste management companies and recyclers. Similar programs are in place in Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand.\n",
      "In Brazil, SustentaPET collection centers take in more than 700,000 PET bottles a day to produce recycled resin that ultimately becomes new packaging. In its first three years, the program has recycled more than 83,000 metric tons of PET—and will expand to additional states in 2023.\n",
      "In Egypt, we partner with BariQ, the largest bottle-to-bottle recycling plant in the Middle East, to recycle 14,000 metric tons of plastic waste annually to food-grade product compatible with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Egyptian Organization for Standardization (EOS).\n",
      "In India, we’re teaming with bicycle grocery delivery service Zepto for the “PET Return and Recycle” initiative. Using the Zepto mobile app, consumers can return up to four empty PET bottles (across any brand) to be collected by Zepto riders during home delivery trips. Following a successful pilot in Mumbai, the program will expand to additional cities.\n",

Ultimately, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors oversees climate-related risks.\n",
      "The involvement of our bottling partners and suppliers is essential to achieving our science- based target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030. The following are examples of how we are working on climate initiatives with partners across our value chain.\n",
      "INCREASING RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) IN MANUFACTURING\n",
      "One critical strategy for reducing emissions in our system is the increased use of renewable energy in our manufacturing processes.\n",
      "Renewable electricity usage, which was third- party assured for the first time in 2021, increased from 12% in 2021 to 21% in 2022.\n",
      "To build knowledge across our system and increase the generation, procurement and accurate reporting of renewable energy, we published a Renewable Energy Implementation Guidebook in March 2022. This guidebook provides a step-by-step process for associates across the system to implement on-site solar photovoltaic and solar hot water and steam systems, on-site and off-site renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), coupled with energy attribute certificates to align with GHG Protocol Scope 2 quality criteria.\n",
      "In addition to the guidebook, we launched a future-facing initiative called the Renewable Energy Project Pipeline in 2022, where we work closely with bottling partners to increase the number of renewable energy projects throughout our system. Approximately 20 bottling partners and 13 concentrate plants have developed 2023–2025 renewable energy plans. As the number and scope of these projects expands, we will look for opportunities to collaborate\n",
      "and share best practices.\n",
      "BOTTLING PARTNERS SET SCIENCE-BASED EMISSIONS TARGETS\n",
      "Given the size of our network of bottling partners, they are critically important in making progress toward our climate ambitions. Our bottling partners have a major influence on emissions reductions based on what they buy, make and deliver for our shared customers\n",
      "and consumers.\n",
      "In September 2022, Arca Continental committed to setting a science-based target. This adds to the growing list of our bottlers with approved emissions reductions goals through the Science- Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This list includes Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (CCHBC), Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), AB Inbev, Swire Coca-Cola Limited and Coca-Cola FEMSA.\n",
      "We will be working to grow this list in 2023.\n",
      "ENGAGING WITH SUPPLIERS TO TAKE ACTION ON CLIMATE\n",
      "We continue to find new ways to collaborate and support our suppliers to collectively reduce emissions.\n",
      "In 2022, we joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LoCT) initiative, led by Guidehouse along with 18 other companies to mobilize collective climate action by providing suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to accelerate their decarbonization. As of the end of 2022, there were 94 suppliers to the Coca-Cola system participating in the initiative. The company is directly sponsoring 56 of these suppliers. The program is showing signs of success—10 suppliers that we sponsored, who successfully completed the program, have since set or committed to setting their own SBTi- approved emissions targets.\n",
      "Thanks to The Coca-Cola Company, in April 2022 we had the great opportunity to join the Supplier LoCT initiative. This program helped us to improve the way we calculate our Scope 1 & 2\n",

      "NICOLAS LOOTENS\n",
      "Group Sustainability Manager, Vetropak\n",
      "In total, more than 160 of our suppliers have set or committed to setting SBTi-approved emissions targets.\n",
      "Reducing Emissions from Coolers\n",
      "Coolers have long been a key opportunity because approximately one-third of our emissions comes from cold-drink equipment and dispensing. In early 2023, building on analysis we conducted in 2022, we published internal guidance for coolers used across our value chain. The guidance sets specific energy usage limits, which will require increasing energy efficiency between now and 2030 and help drive the replacement of older, less efficient coolers.\n",
      "We are also installing more “intelligent connected” coolers that can transmit data such as product throughput, maintenance status, temperature and energy use, which has operational benefits in addition to helping reduce emissions.\n",
      "In 2022, 88% of all new coolers placed were HFC-free. This is an increase from 61% of coolers placed in 2016.\n",
      "WHAT’S NEXT?\n",
      "IMPROVING DATA SCOPE AND ACCURACY\n",
      "Gathering complete and accurate data is critical to identifying a path to achieving our science- based target. We are continuously improving the scope and detail of our data collection to ensure all significant sources of emissions across our value chain are included in our inventory. We are updating our 2015 baseline data due to recent acquisitions. Improving our data helps us prioritize projects and programs with the greatest impact, including more detail on renewable energy usage and more data from suppliers.\n",
      "Validate Renewable Energy Claims\n",
      "One area of focus has been to validate the accuracy and completeness of our renewable energy claims. We have done this through assuring our claims to the GHG Protocol. This work began in 2021 and continued through 2022.\n",
      "Suppliers Disclose Data and Targets\n",
      "Because approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from goods and services we buy, it is essential to engage with suppliers to accurately capture our full scope 3 emissions and ensure our suppliers join our decarbonization journey. Each year, we encourage key suppliers to complete CDP’s Supply Chain Climate Change questionnaire, which provides useful data on GHG emissions in our supply chain and information on supplier targets and initiatives to\n",
      "reduce emissions. In 2022, 378 suppliers provided climate data to CDP out of 495 requested,\n",
      "a 12% increase from 2021.\n",
      "Additionally, we are working to improve data accuracy in partnership with several major suppliers across ingredients and packaging, starting with sugar and aluminum, in order to develop supplier-specific emissions factors for the commodities we procure. This allows us to better\n",
      "understand our supply chain, drive change and more accurately track emissions reductions of specific suppliers and commodities in key areas.\n",
      "Even deeper in our supply chain, work is underway to map and understand how land, water use and farming practices in our major agricultural sourcing regions both generate emissions and have the potential to reduce emissions. Costa began its own work in 2022, launching a Climate Smart coffee project in partnership with the Rainforest Alliance. Phase 1 of the project has been to conduct a GHG\n",

For example, in 2022, in partnership with Doktar, an agri-tech company, and with funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation, we launched a project in the regions of Bursa and Tekirdağ in Türkiye, which are priority sourcing regions for apples. The project aims to improve irrigation efficiency and agricultural practices on approximately 500 acres of land growing apples, peaches, nectarines and tomatoes, which are major water users. Sensors will be installed to monitor climate and soil moisture conditions and satellite data (Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) will be used to calculate levels of evapotranspiration. All of this data will be combined to provide personalized irrigation programs for participating farmers and help to avoid excessive watering.\n",

      "a global sustainable packaging platform focused on these fundamental goals: Making 100% of our packaging recyclable globally by 2025—and using at least 50% recycled material in our packaging by 2030 (Design); collecting and recycling a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030 (Collect); and bringing people together to support a healthy, debris-free environment (Partner).\n",
