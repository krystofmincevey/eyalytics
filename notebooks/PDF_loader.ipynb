    "## Attempt 1:\n",
    "Load in textual information seperately from tabular information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading Text:**\n",
    "To get more structured results, you can dive a bit deeper into the pdfminer library to analyze the individual layout components of the PDF. By iterating through these components, you can customize your extraction strategy based on the type and structure of each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more granular approach using pdfminer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parse the PDF and extract layout objects.\n",
    "- Classify each object based on its type (text box, image, line, etc.)\n",
    "- Custom process each text box, ensuring tables (previously identified) are skipped to avoid duplicate extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading Table:**\n",
    "This automatic detection sometimes confuses text layouts with tables, especially when the text is arranged in columns or has other grid-like structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refine the extraction process, we can use a combination of heuristic approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Density Check: For each table detected by camelot, calculate the text density. If there's a lot of whitespace relative to text, it might not be a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row and Column Count: Check the number of rows and columns. If there's just one column or one row, it might be just regular text instead of a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row Uniformity: Check if the rows have similar content. If each row is wildly different in terms of content length or type, it might not be a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvements**:\n",
    "Few additional ideas and improvements could help capture more structured content:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Context Preservation around Tables:*\n",
    "As you mentioned, it might be valuable to add sentences or headings appearing immediately before and after tables as added context.You can modify the extract_text_custom function to look for text boxes immediately above and below identified table regions and append these to the table markdown content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Images and Figures Extraction:*\n",
    "Right now, the images or figures are skipped. Depending on the nature of the PDFs you're working with, images, charts, and figures might contain essential information. Tools like Pytesseract can be used to OCR images, but the quality of results can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use PyPDF2 for Meta Information:*\n",
    "Sometimes the meta information of a PDF, such as the title, author, or other metadata, contains important context about the content. You can extract this with PyPDF2 and include it in your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Error Handling for Individual Pages:*\n",
    "Instead of failing the entire operation when an error occurs on one page, you can handle errors on a per-page basis. This way, even if one page causes an issue, the rest of the pages can still be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Text Post-processing:*\n",
    "Once the text is extracted, you might notice inconsistencies like broken sentences or words. Depending on the quality and structure of the PDFs, some text post-processing might be helpful. This could involve:\n",
    "- Removing any residual special characters or artifacts.\n",
    "- Reconstructing broken sentences.\n",
    "- Removing footers, headers, or repeated elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Parallel Processing:*\n",
    "If the processing time becomes an issue, especially with large PDFs, you can consider parallel processing for different pages. This would involve extracting content from multiple pages concurrently. Python’s multiprocessing module can help here."
